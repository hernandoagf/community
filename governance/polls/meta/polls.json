    "discussionLink": "https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mandate-risk-teams/282",
    "content": "# Poll: Ratify the Interim Risk Team Mandate\n\n# Introduction\n\nRisk teams are ecosystem participants responsible for managing the various risks in the Dai Credit System. They are tasked with managing the collateral portfolio and recommending appropriate monetary policy while adhering to the principles of scientific governance. Due to the decentralized nature of MakerDAO, there are a number of considerations the community should discuss surrounding the onboarding and management of risk teams.\n\nThe Maker Foundation is proposing an operational framework intended to guide both MKR token holders and risk teams through the governance process. After a period of one week, (set aside for debate and iteration), the community will have the opportunity to formally choose to accept or reject this proposition in a governance poll. Acceptance of the proposal will signal the ratification of this mandate and the associated processes and procedures.\n\n## Examining the Landscape\n\nThe need for risk teams is best understood following an analysis of the core components of the Dai Credit System. We begin with a brief recap and the risks contained within.\n\nMakerDAO is an Ethereum-based DAO that operates the Dai Credit System, a permissionless loan facility. The Dai Credit System issues the cryptocurrency Dai, a stablecoin designed to track \\$1 USD with low volatility. The core function allows users to self-issue Dai-denominated loans against collateral deposited into smart contract-based escrow. Collateral can be retrieved upon repayment of the outstanding Dai amount plus an associated Stability Fee. This architecture poses two pressing concerns. Where does Dai source its value, and what compels it to remain pegged to USD? The answers to these two questions are the focal points of most risk analysis surrounding Dai. To better understand these risks we briefly explore Maker’s internal mechanics.\n\nDai stability is dependent on a system of carefully crafted incentives. At the core is the collateral portfolio, a pool of on-chain digital assets that back the Dai supply. While the collateral presents a source of value, additional heuristics are required to maintain a soft peg of \\$1. In particular, the Dai Credit System incentivizes arbitrageurs to buy and sell Dai in the open marketplace. This arbitrage is supported by monetary policy adjustments that influence the supply and demand for Dai recursively until Dai has returned back to its target price. Market makers have come to rely on these Stability Fee changes, and as a result supply the necessary liquidity to minimize outsized deviations.\n\nIn extreme events, 1 Dai can be redeemed for \\$1 worth of collateral through a process known as Emergency Shutdown. However, collateral values can sometimes fluctuate dramatically. If they were to suffer a sharp decline in value, the settlement feature enabled by Emergency Shutdown may not allow for full redemption. As a last line of defense against volatile asset prices, a buffer in the form of MKR tokens exists to soak up undercollateralized Dai. The distributed set of MKR token holders (“MTH”) are ultimately the group motivated to ensure the successful operation of the Dai Credit System.\n\nMKR token holders coordinate themselves using a decentralized governance process through which they evaluate and select appropriate collateral assets. The success of this endeavor is strongly correlated to a proficient risk evaluation of the collateral set. A failure in due diligence or coordination will result in severe losses for both end users of the protocol (in the form of declining Dai price) as well as MTH (in the form of MKR dilution). While the incentives for MTH are clear, executing the plan requires additional work.\n\n## The Need for Risk Teams\n\nThere is considerable overhead with respect to quantifying risk in the Dai Credit System and managing it appropriately. It is not practical (nor necessarily advisable) for MTH to directly analyze it themselves. A simple and intuitive solution is to outsource risk specialists who are tasked with evaluation of the risks. While the traditional model of a centralized risk function could operate as a bootstrapping mechanism, we also propose a more robust and decentralized blueprint.\n\nThe primary idea is to create the Decentralized Risk Function, a process by which distributed teams of independent risk specialists are incentivized to exercise due diligence on the collateral portfolio and create models for appropriate monetary policy. The decentralized model affords us a near limitless talent pool, blanket coverage, and uninterrupted operation. Additionally, decentralized risk teams are designed to be resistant to capture from biased ecosystem actors; risk teams operate solely for the benefit of MTH.\n\nThrough the governance process, the MTH are responsible for managing the operational aspects of Maker risk teams. Here we propose a set of guidelines for MTH through which they may oversee risk teams. Immediately, there are several operational details that need to be addressed:\n\n- What are the types of risk that need to be managed?\n- Are there different types of risk teams?\n- How does one ‘become’ a risk team?\n- How do they create and submit risk models?\n- How are they compensated?\n\n## Types of Risk\n\nThere are three broad classifications of risk in the Dai Credit System: collateral risk, monetary policy risk, and exogenous risks.\n\n### Collateral Risk\n\nCollateral risk refers to the likelihood of an event where a sudden asset price decline triggers the liquidation of a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). As mentioned above, the primary assurance for Dai holders is the collateral portfolio. Naturally, a comprehensive understanding of all collateral assets is a prerequisite for proper risk management. Qualitative factors, market liquidity, and recourse methodologies are all in scope and must be carefully analyzed. As a simple example, because illiquid or fundamentally risky assets have a higher predisposition to sudden crashes, a proportionately higher risk premium must be assessed.\n\n### Monetary Policy Risk\n\nMonetary policy presents the second major risk classification, refers to managing the supply and demand for Dai. In spite of the quality of the collateral evaluation, the Dai price is still subject to the whims of the market as CDP creators (generators of Dai supply) may not perfectly align with Dai holders (representing Dai demand). Risk levers such as the Stability Fee and Dai Savings Rate can be used to influence both CDP and Dai holder behavior in order to facilitate a market equilibrium at \\$1. Because the supply and demand for Dai fluctuates based on a variety of market factors, creating an accurate model requires a sound understanding of economics, statistics, market psychology, and more. For example, in Single-Collateral Dai there is clearly a relationship between the ether price and the Dai price. Analyzing this correlation in order to make optimal policy recommendations is an important function of decentralized governance.\n\n## Exogenous Risks\n\nFinally, exogenous risk refers to a spate of additional risks, among them oracles, governance, and more. Oracle attacks, or the presumed susceptibility of the collateral price feeds, must be well understood. For example, to what extent can an attacker siphon value from the system if they were to subvert the price feeds? What would the appropriate countermeasures be in such a scenario? Another type of exogenous risk is threats to the governance process. Social attacks or improper procedures might necessitate an Emergency Shutdown to preserve the legitimacy of MakerDAO.\n\n## Types of Risk Teams\n\nNot all risk teams will undertake the same duties and job functions. Because different analysts will have distinct specialties and skills, it is helpful to categorize them accordingly. However, it is our assumption that a rich ecosystem of specialized risk teams will develop over time and when needed. For now, we define the broadest types of risk teams that will work for the DAO. Over time, as the needs for risk assessment become more specialized, we can expect to see additional roles.\n\n### Submitting Risk Teams\n\nSubmitting risk teams are the most fundamental class of risk teams. They are in charge of computing and submitting risk parameters to the governance process.\n\nThe most basic responsibility is to evaluate specific assets or sectors. For example, experts in the cryptocurrency space will examine coins such as bitcoin or ether, whereas traditional risk analysts might find the Security Tokens space more suitable. The goal is to provide an examination of the risks for including a collateral asset into the portfolio.\n\nA sub-class of risk teams might be generalists who are in charge of tying together the various collateral types in a cohesive portfolio. One of the primary responsibilities is to factor in proper correlation coefficients, a task they will likely collaborate on with the other teams. A second critical role is to factor in the appropriate monetary policy. Submitting risk teams will be in charge of suggesting appropriate DSR values, as well as any collateral-specific adjustments that might be required. After construction of the collateral portfolio with the appropriate monetary policy parameters, they can then submit the final package to the governance cycle.\n\n### Oracle Teams\n\nOracle Teams are in charge of developing and distributing oracle backend software, as well as emergency oracle programs. For example, when new collateral assets are added, they must be accompanied with a corresponding price oracle. An Oracle Team is in charge of facilitating the inclusion of that oracle. Lastly, an Oracle Team may oversee the productization of any oracle services.\n\n### Looking Ahead\n\nIn the future, we can expect to see several other classes of risk teams. Supporting risk teams may just work on research or data science, without seeing a model through to the calculation of risk parameters. Blockchain Development Teams might work on upgrading MakerDAO infrastructure. Technical specialists are also likely to find a niche in the ecosystem. The community should slowly increase the scope of risk teams as the Dai Credit System matures.\n\n## Risk Constructs\n\nWhen a risk team is ready to begin work on a risk model, we expect that they adhere to a standardized set of rules. By following strict guidelines in terms of how a risk assessment is conducted, MTH can more easily vet the legitimacy of the process. In this section we propose some principles that every risk model should abide by, along with a description of a sample model. Collectively, this package is known as a risk construct.\n\n### Scientific Governance\n\nThe guiding principle for all risk constructs is the notion of scientific risk governance, a process by which all risk parameter suggestions are supported by appropriate financial models and data analytics. We propose a set of principles or qualities that scientific risk constructs should comprise.\n\n- Comprehensive A risk construct should be exhaustive such that all relevant classifications of risk are considered and reviewed. A risk team must delve into the fundamentals of the organization, consider the value proposition of the collateral, and evaluate any potential risks. In the context of monetary policy, appropriate models must be applied that harmonize the exogenous factors impacting the Dai price.\n- Scientific A risk team must be rigorous and scientific in its methodologies. While subjective reasoning can often be an unavoidable part of a risk evaluation, general models should be designed to guide a risk team towards being as objective as possible.\n- Standardization A standardized template adhered to by all risk teams allows MTH to review a diverse set of due diligence reports that can easily be compared with one another. The goal is to eliminate any potential oversights or unintentional biases by individual risk teams such that the MTH are left with only an objective evaluation of the collateral.\n- Reproducible Critically, a model must be reproducible in nature. This entails making data and code publicly available. Third party auditors should be able to independently run the model on a publicly-sourced data set and arrive at the same conclusions as the risk team. A scenario in which MTH cannot verify the legitimacy of a particular risk team’s risk parameters jeopardizes the integrity of the Dai Credit System.\n\nWith the scientific governance principles squarely in place, a risk team may continue on towards an operational risk assessment of the proposed collateral type or monetary policy. The composition of a risk construct should contain at a minimum the following: data set, general model, and applied model.\n\n### Data Set\n\nRisk teams should use a transparent and auditable data set for the purposes of risk models. The source of the data should be clear. The data set should also be hosted somewhere that it can be downloaded by independent risk analysts. For example, trading data used for liquidity analysis should be included as part of the risk construct. Additionally, any transformations made to the data (such as wash trade filtering or any other types of averages) should be specified.\n\n### General Model\n\nThe general model is a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or other part of the risk function. For example, proposed valuation models, heuristics, and fundamental analysis should be described in detail. Cryptoasset evaluations would require generalized frameworks on how to value various classes of tokens. DSR formulas should be accompanied with detailed and annotated statistical models.\n\nThe general model at the core should contain three parts:\n\n- A framework for fundamental analysis or due diligence. How does one go about evaluating a cryptoasset’s fundamentals? How does one think about DSR changes? The ideas and models behind a risk team’s line of thinking should be described.\n- A scoring framework for collateral assets that enables a standardized approach for converting qualitative analysis into numerical outputs. This is achieved through a ratings-based methodology.\n- A quantitative model that describes the process for computing risk parameters such as the Stability Fee, Liquidation Ratio, DSR, etc. What types of financial models are used? What are their tradeoffs?\n\nMTH are limited in the number of collateral types they may process in a given time period. The general model can help determine which assets should be given priority as approved assets make their way into the collateral pool. The general model acts as a natural filtration mechanism where collateral types are ranked against one another for prioritization purposes.\n\n### Applied Model\n\nThe applied model should be a specific implementation of the general model. For example, if a risk team wishes to evaluate ether they would apply the principles and evaluation framework presented in their general model. The final risk model should, in some regards, operate on rails. A valid data set in conjunction with a risk analysis framework presented in the general model should result in a deterministic set of risk parameters.\n\nOne key consequence of this process is that governance would debate only the validity and strength of the underlying general model (and associated data set), but not the output. If a particular model results in risk parameters that are deemed undesirable after the fact, they cannot be changed arbitrarily. Instead, governance must revisit the general model and debate whether or not it is of sufficient quality, and discuss why it was allowed to be ratified in the first place. It is imperative that general models not be changed after being voted in. Deliberately ignoring key aspects of the general model would result in a failure of the governance process.\n\nIt is important to stress that the role of a risk team is to merely provide suggestions for risk parameters. Ultimately, MTH are the ones who vote in parameters that constitute the Dai Credit System. They are the group solely responsible for governing the Dai Credit System.\n\n## Onboarding Risk Teams\n\nThe final section of this document surrounds the onboarding and management of risk teams themselves, along with the process by which they submit risk constructs. Due to the decentralized nature of MakerDAO, it can be surprisingly difficult to foster an efficient process for handling risk teams. A number of edge cases must be considered before pushing forward. Therefore we suggest a number of operational constraints designed to protect against potential governance attacks on the ecosystem.\n\n### Application\n\nQualified risk analysts who wish to contribute to the Decentralized Risk Function should follow an application process in order to become an official risk team. A candidate risk team would begin by publicly posting credentials to the MakerDAO Forum, resembling a formal engagement process. For example, prior experience, team members, and other qualifications should be surfaced here.\n\nIn conjunction with the credentials, a candidate risk team should provide a detailed proposal outlining the type of risk work they would like to do. This General Proposal (GP) might outline a risk construct for ether or a new methodology for calculating the DSR. It is expected that the GP would include a desired compensation amount, similar to a contractor agreement.\n\n### Bootstrapping the Application Review\n\nDue to potential overhead and friction involved with a candidate risk team negotiating terms with a decentralized organization, the Maker Foundation will help bootstrap the process by dealing directly with risk teams. The Maker Foundation will review General Proposals and also compensate these teams directly.\n\nThis bootstrapping phase is intended to facilitate the growth of risk teams until a robust decentralized framework for proposal review and Stability Fee compensation can be put into place. We strongly recommend the community begin exploring operational frameworks for how they might like to see this process evolve.\n\n### Long Term Vision\n\nWe can also opine on what the longer term vision might look like. Upon submission of a General Proposal, MTH, in their governance capacity, will then have the opportunity to review them as part of its regular governance cycle. If a GP is approved, a risk team may then begin work on the risk construct. One of the edge cases to keep in mind is a risk team trying to immediately push through new risk parameters that have not undergone sufficient review by the community. To this end, we propose a concept of ‘lead times.’\n\nLead times are essentially delay functions that should be respected before a risk team may progress through the governance cycle. After a GP has been approved, we suggest that a minimum of one month to pass before a candidate risk team submits their general model to the community. At this point, the community should review and give feedback on the general model. We recommend an additional one month of discussion (and iteration) on the general model prior to submitting the final risk construct into the governance cycle.\n\nThe length of the lead time need not be a fully rigid framework. The community can decide if special circumstances allow for standard convention to be suspended. However, the risk that a proposal hasn’t had enough time for consideration needs to always be taken into account. It is not difficult to envision potential governance attacks from malicious attackers trying to rapidly push through risk constructs.\n\n### Approval\n\nWhen a risk construct is approved by MTH, it can be said that the risk team has also been approved. Additional risk constructs submitted by the risk team may potentially flow through the governance cycle faster, especially if they fall under the same general model. Risk constructs based on an entirely new general model should begin the approval process from the start.\n\nAt the inception of Multi-Collateral Dai, the Interim Risk Team will post a risk construct for the initial collateral set. Approval of this risk construct will officially ratify the Interim Risk Team.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMany details for this coordination process will likely emerge organically over time as the governance process improves. As the risk community expands, a number of questions should be explored as we iterate this framework:\n\n- Performance review is an important aspect of risk team management. How can the community facilitate this process?\n- A risk team will likely build up a reputation based on their performance, and stronger risk teams will naturally have greater influence in the parameter selection process. Should this be a formalized process with rating points? What privileges do highly ranked risk teams have?\n- How can we design decentralized review and compensation framework for candidate risk teams?\n\nIf this mandate is accepted by the community, it will signal its support for the general scope of the initiatives outlined. This mandate should be considered a living document and will be updated based on community feedback.\n",

    "content": "# Poll: Ratify the Interim Governance Facilitator Mandate\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Maker Foundation is proposing a new role, the Interim Governance Facilitator, which is responsible for maintaining the ecosystem supporting the governance process. This role will follow the same ‘interim' model shared by other foundation teams and is designed to, eventually, be entirely community-driven.\n\n*\"Interim Governance Facilitators (IGFs) are tasked with ensuring the smooth operation of the governance process. This involves a wide range of activities, anything from general administration to signals gathering to governance scheduling.\"*\n\nTheir key function, though, is encapsulated in the name of the role, _facilitation_. The primary duty of the Facilitators is to ensure the smooth and efficient running of the distributed and open source governance process at Maker.\n\nAs this document represents a formalization of the role he already occupies on behalf of the community, the Foundation is proposing that Richard Brown, Head of Community Development, be the first Interim Governance Facilitator.\n\nAfter a period of two weeks (set aside for debate and iteration on this framework), the community will have the opportunity to formally choose to accept or reject the proposal in a governance poll.\n\n**Acceptance of the proposal will signal the ratification of the new role, the person chosen to exercise its mandate, the associated processes and procedures, and calendar outlined in this document.**\n\n### Why Do We Need Facilitation?\n\nBecause governance is built on ever-shifting sands, the community needs to maintain as much agility as it can without sacrificing velocity. As the decisions that happen in Maker governance can have wide-ranging effects on the entire DeFi ecosystem, we need to keep vigilant against attack (from within and without) and to ensure the process runs smoothly, with as much integrity as possible.\n\n## Defining the Role\n\nLike the other major governance-related roles, such as the Interim Risk Team and the Oracle team, the Facilitators are empowered _by the community_ to perform tasks _on behalf of the community_.\n\nThe Foundation is proposing this first iteration of a role that we hope will evolve through guidance provided by the community. After sufficient baseline processes have been established for the Interim Governance Facilitator, and proven successful, additional Governance Facilitators should begin to be onboarded. Working in concert across all major time zones, they will coordinate to ensure global access to the inner workings of Maker governance.\n\nThe Interim Facilitator is responsible for gradually bootstrapping the governance processes and procedures necessary to create a more robust governance framework. This will be achieved through a rigorous cycle of policy proposal, feedback gathering, and through regular coordination with other governance stakeholders.\n\nAs the following roles, responsibilities, and mandates of the Interim Facilitator become more clearly defined, we look forward to tasks being taken on by additional, community-sourced, Facilitators.\n\n## Primary Responsibilities\n\n### Ownership and Management of the Official Communications Channels\n\nGovernance Facilitators are responsible for ensuring the health and integrity of official communication channels like forums and chat rooms. These tasks include moderation duties, establishing processes and social norms, broadcasting relevant information to the wider world, as well as defending the channels from trolling and Sybil attack.\n\n### Defining the Governance ‘Problem Space'\n\nBecause Facilitators are empowered by the community as a whole, they cannot be seen to be partisan. They are not empowered to make ‘governance' decisions, cannot campaign for any specific governance issue, nor should they express opinions about the merits of one polling or voting option over another. They must remain neutral and objective and focus wholly on policy, procedure, and facilitation.\n\nFor example: a Facilitator _should not_ suggest to the community that the Stability Fee should be raised or lowered, put forward an alteration to monetary or risk policy, or express an opinion about the desirability of one asset type over another.\n\nThe role is one of collating and framing meaningful discussions and soliciting the community for appropriate solutions to issues as they arise. Once those solutions have been debated, the Facilitator is responsible for enacting processes that allow for various levels of consensus to be established and actions to be taken by Maker Token Holders.\n\nFor example: a Facilitator would work with the members of the forum to establish rules around the creation of forum polls, appropriate phrasing, poll duration, etc. Once a poll has successfully concluded, the Governance Facilitator would be responsible for communicating that consensus to the wider community and, if required, ensuring that the poll is added to the governance portal for official ratification.\n\n### Advocacy\n\nGovernance Facilitators are responsible for raising community governance issues back to the Foundation or the third-party ecosystem and ensuring appropriate follow up for the community.\n\n### Bootstrapping Process\n\nA governance model that is capable of managing a rapidly developing ecosystem as ours needs to be capable of iterating just as quickly. Governance Facilitators are tasked with nurturing the processes and procedures that will allow the community to rapidly develop in concert with the requirements of governance.\n\n#### \"The users of governance have to shape governance.\"\n\nGovernance is a hard problem and will continue to be so as the needs of the community grow, and the requirements of the system become increasingly sophisticated. Governance Facilitators will be responsible for preparing the community to iterate rapidly and effectively as we move along the long path to eventual decentralization.\n\nFacilitators will work closely with community members to identify and refine emergent process and workflows that can allow such a large and distributed ‘remote team' of stakeholders to work together.\n\nSome questions Facilitators will collaborate with the community to answer:\n\n- **Frameworks**\n  - How do we create canonical reference materials?\n  - Where do they live?\n- **General Communications**\n  - How do we effectively broadcast governance issues to the wider community?\n  - How do we increase engagement?\n- **Polls, Votes, and Signals**\n  - What are the best practices we should adopt when collecting, filtering, and identifying useful signals?\n- **Manage Debate**\n  - Where does it live? How do we set the tone?\n  - When does a debate end?\n- **Workflows**\n  - Where does ‘work' happen?\n  - What pipelines and workflows do we need to formalize?\n\n### Framing the Debate\n\nAs Facilitators are charged with maintaining and encouraging debate, they need to be vigilant in ensuring that the community adheres to the guidelines outlined in the [Scientific Governance and Risk Framework](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework/part-one) and the [Core Foundation Principals](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/core-principles).\n\nFor example, as a community, we debate the merits of the data being input into the system and the models themselves; opinions or debates about outputs are to be avoided. Unsubstantiated opinions are to be avoided in general.\n\nProblems are more readily solved by reminding the community that they are ultimately in charge of the outputs of the governance process.\n\nFacilitators should:\n\n- De-emphasize \"Why don't you…?\" questions.\n- Emphasize \"How can we…?\" questions.\n\nMaintaining a healthy debate is critical to the success of any community. It will be one of the most important duties of the Facilitators to ensure that the caliber of discussion remain high, that new members of the community understand the general level of decorum and civility expected by the group, that they have the resources they need to get onboarded quickly, and that the community doesn't suffer attrition from toxicity, trolling, or apathy.\n\n### Establishing Consensus\n\nOnce debate has ended, it's time to identify and encourage consensus-seeking behaviours. This is a pivotal and complicated task.\n\nSome questions the Facilitators will help the community to align on:\n\n- What does consensus mean?\n- Where do we find it?\n- How much consensus is enough?\n- How do we maximize alignment between the Foundation, the voters, and various unaligned stakeholders?\n- How do we promote consensus-seeking behaviours?\n- How do we deal with contrarians and those unwilling to compromise?\n- What does the ‘least bad option' look like?\n- Do we seek assent or assume it by looking for dissent instead?\n\nOnce the community has established the answers to these questions, the Facilitators are responsible for ensuring they are codified and adhered to. Finally, the Facilitators ensure they are communicated effectively to the wider ecosystem.\n\n### Communicating and Scheduling the Roadmap\n\nAmong many other things, governance is also a scheduling problem. The actions that Maker Token Holders need to take are dependent on a host of factors. The activities of partners, regulators, market forces, emerging verticals, etc., combine to create a high number of dependencies. Ensuring that there is a reasonably accurate short-term roadmap is the responsibility of the facilitators.\n\nThey will achieve this by maintaining public documentation and roadmaps that will provide engaged stakeholders with the information they need to participate with the system and anticipate next steps. Through this constant iteration with the Foundation and the governance ecosystem, they will help the community to shape the future of the DAO.\n\n### Coordinating with other Ratified Teams\n\nGovernance Facilitators are a ‘meta team' tasked with facilitating and supporting the actions of the rest of the mandated actors in the governance ecosystem.\n\nIt will be key that public and transparent communication channels are set up, which allow the Risk, Oracle, and Governance teams to coordinate.\n\n### Handling Emergencies\n\nThere will likely be situations where the governance community must respond quickly to new information. It will be the job of the Facilitators to work with the community to establish an emergency voting process to defend the system against unplanned events.\n\n## Managing the Governance Facilitators\n\nAlthough the role has been architected in such a way as to minimise any potential decision-making power, there may come a time when a Facilitator needs to be removed from the role.\n\nWhether for reasons of overstepping of mandates, an inability or unwillingness to enact community-supported initiatives, or a general lack of competence, there must be a system for alerting facilitators to a need for improvement or for replacing them altogether.\n\nSome topics for the community to explore in the coming weeks and months:\n\n- How does the community formally disagree with a Facilitator?\n- How do we attract and train new Facilitators?\n- Should Governance Facilitators have a term limit?\n- How are they compensated?\n- How do they coordinate with each other?\n- How do we measure Facilitator success?\n- How do we get rid of a bad Facilitator?\n\nA possible solution to consider in the future:\n\nShould we have an ongoing ‘confidence' poll for each Governance Facilitator? What happens in the event of an attack? What if a whale seeks to replace a person with a more amenable version?\n\nIf the ‘abuse of power' poll ever disappears, then perhaps an ‘Emergency Governance Cycle' could start. What that looks like is still to be determined.\n\n## Collateral Onboarding Priority Poll Process\n\nFacilitators are responsible for ensuring that new collateral types are added to the system by providing a clear path to doing so and effectively communicating the requirements and resources provided by the Risk Teams.\n\nFor example, a facilitator would be responsible for shepherding a process like the following, by working closely with the risk teams:\n\n- **Submission:** Partners submit their collateral onboarding proposals in the Governance category in the forums. Once the proper due diligence has been completed, and the forum polls have finished with a supportive vote, the collateral type will be added to the next asset priority list poll.\n\n- **Presentation:** Through a governance call, an asset will be presented for review before the portal poll. This is _not_ a decision making step; this is part of the Communicating and Scheduling section outlined above.\n\n- **Prioritization:** Once an asset has been added to the long term wishlist, it will be sorted through a priority poll. As other top picks are onboarded and removed from the long term wishlist, it should eventually reach the top of the list for inclusion.\n\n- **Pre-Evaluation:** All of the mandated and ratified teams then perform their risk evaluation on the assets at the top of the list. After the evaluation processes are complete, the team in question will mark the collateral with a) passed, b) passed but will take longer to finish, or c) rejected.\n\n- **Evaluation:** After a collateral asset has been accepted as being viable from all the relevant teams, they can then begin to do the full review and development of the risk construct and onboarding. Once a team has finished doing what they need to do for a given collateral type, they will mark it as \"ready to go.\"\n\n- **Short Term Wishlist:** Once a collateral asset has received the ready-to-go mark from all the relevant teams, it is removed from the long term wishlist and added to the short term wishlist.\n\n- **Queued for Next Governance Cycle:** Once a collateral asset is on the short term wishlist, it can be added to General Risk Teams' Risk constructs and get passed in the following governance cycle.\n\n## The Framework, the Calendar, and Next Steps\n\nThe process of ratifying a Governance Facilitator, much like a Risk Team, is one of signaling **_support for a package of roles, responsibilities, principles, and processes_**. Polling in a new facilitator represents the community's acceptance of the whole package and includes an associated roadmap and calendar. It is that calendar that allows the community to move ahead with governance.\n\nThis will involve a _Bootstrapping_ phase where the community debates and ratifies the roles and processes required to begin the second _Governance Cycle_ phase.\n\n**_Please note: This roadmap is dependent on a collaborative effort spread amongst the Foundation, our partners, and the governance community. We cannot predict when dependencies may mis-align. It may be periodically updated, items may be added or removed, and the dates may change at any time._**\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\n#### Week of August 12\n\n- **Proposal:** Interim Governance Facilitator Mandate\n- **Poll:** Collateral Asset Priority List\n\n#### Week of August 19\n\n- **Proposal:** Interim Risk Team Mandate\n\n#### Week of August 26\n\n- **Proposal** - DSR Initial Values\n- **Poll** - Ratify the Governance Facilitator and Interim Risk Team\n\n#### Week of September 9\n\n- **Proposals** - Oracle Team Mandate\n- **Proposals** - New Oracle Providers\n- **Proposals** - Oracle Incentive Restructuring\n\n#### Week of September 16\n\n- **Proposal -** MCD Whitepaper\n- **Poll -** Ratify Oracle Team\n\n#### Week of September 23\n\n- **Poll** - Long-term Collateral Asset Priority List\n- **Proposal** - The General Risk Model\n\n#### TBD\n\n- **Documentation -** MCD Executive Vote Changelog\n- **Poll -** Initial Oracle Values\n- **Poll -** Initial DSR Values\n- **Executive -** Initializing the MCD system prior to launch\n\n### Governance cycles, DAO team onboarding, and other proposals\n\nAfter the Bootstrapping phase of the governance schedule has ended, we will switch to a regular cadence of discussion, debate, signal gathering, review, before the onchain polling and executive process begins.\n\nThat onchain process could take many forms, from a simple cycle of proposal, review, voting to a more sophisticated process such as the following:\n\n**Week 1: Request for Proposals -** The Risk Teams will present the assets they have analysed to the forums for review. In the Governance call, the community will debate the risk construct and surface any contention. The Risk Teams have this week to accept final feedback from the community and to iterate.\n\nThis week may also include the introduction of general administrative proposals not related directly to collateral onboarding.\n\nThis week could also include an executive vote ratifying the previous month's governance cycle.\n\n**Week 2: Request for Comments -** We continue to evaluate the Risk Constructs and General Proposals of the previous week and review updates and merge in changes.\n\n**Week 3: Collateral Inclusion Polls -** We start the week with an Inclusion Poll which allows for the individual approval of the prior two weeks' General Proposals and Risk Constructs.\n\n**Week 4: Final Collateral Wrap-up Poll -** We begin a governance poll which is a rollup of the previous weeks' Inclusion Polls.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf this mandate is accepted by the community, it will signal its support for the new Governance Facilitator Role, Richard Brown as the first Interim Governance Facilitator, and signals support for the general scope of the initiatives outlined in this mandate. \n\nThis mandate should be considered a living document and will be updated based on community feedback.\n",

    "content": "# Poll: Oracles Incentives Restructuring\n\n## Introduction\n\nFor context for this proposal, please view the [Oracle V2 Announcement](https://blog.makerdao.com/introducing-oracles-v2-and-defi-feeds/). This proposal was already addressed on the Governance Calls on [September 5th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKNv8DMxmQ&t=3309) and [September 12th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqVnwOL42hQ&t=1283).\n\nTo further decentralize the Maker Protocol, this proposal aims to create an incentive model that fundamentally aligns the different agents of the Oracle ecosystem to create a decentralized, sustainable, and secure Oracle network. The three agents that comprise this system are MKR token holders, Feeds, and Data Consumers. Their relationships are outlined in the figure below.\n\n![|624x523](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makerdao/community/master/governance/polls/assets/Oracles%20Incentives%20Restructuring.jpeg)\n\nFeeds are individuals and organizations who submit asset prices to the Oracles smart contracts. They are compensated for this service by MKR token holders through a monthly Feed Stipend (see diagram). Currently, the Feed Stipend is being funded by the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation. In the future, the Feed Stipend is expected to be sourced from the Stability Fees generated by the Maker Protocol. **Formal acceptance of this proposal does NOT change the Feed Stipend to be sourced from Stability Fees. As such, governance cannot change the Feed Stipend amount until governance changes it to be sourced from Stability Fees.**\n\nFeeds act as data inputs to the Oracles so the Oracles can provide a canonical price for an asset. This canonical price can be read and utilized by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain such as the Maker Protocol. The ability to read this price is regulated by a whitelist. The whitelist is a list of smart contract addresses which are permitted to read the canonical price from the Oracles. This mechanism enables MKR token holders to monetize the Oracles in order to recoup their costs for administering them.\n\nData consumers who want to read prices from the Oracles pay an Oracle Fee in Dai to MKR token holders in exchange for being added to the whitelist. The Oracle Fee can be realized by MKR token holders in the form of a surplus auction or a subsidy to future Feed Stipend payments. The default monthly Oracle Fee is zero Dai until MKR governance votes to raise it.\n\nThis mechanism closes the loop between data producers (i.e., Feeds), data consumers (i.e., dapps), and capital providers (MKR token holders). In doing so, it provides the necessary incentive for MKR holders to engage Feeds to support Oracles for all kinds of assets that dapps require, rather than just the collateral types in the Maker Protocol. In combination with the blockchain-agnostic architecture of Oracles V2, this system of incentives enables the Oracle service to expand to other non-Ethereum blockchains in the future.\n\n**If this proposal is accepted, the following will occur:**\n\n- **The monthly Feed Stipend that each Feed receives will be set to 1000 Dai. This will be funded by the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation.**\n- **A whitelist will be integrated into the Oracle V2 smart contracts which will determine which entities can read the price.**\n- **MKR governors will gain the ability to add/remove entities to/from the Oracle whitelist.**\n- **MKR governors will gain the ability to set the monthly Oracle Fee that entities must pay to be whitelisted (the default fee will be set to zero Dai).**\n- **MKR governors signal their intent to fund Feed Stipends through Stability Fees once the functionality for this has been added to the Maker Protocol.**\n",

The one year interval is specific to each entity.**\n2. **Guarantee the Oracle V1 infrastructure will stay live until at least global settlement of SCD (Single Collateral Dai).**\n\nConducting the migration from Oracles V1 to Oracles V2 in this manner makes a lot of sense from a variety of angles.\n\n## Benefiting Users\n\nIt's necessary to contextualize the state of the Oracle ecosystem as it is today. MakerDAO's Oracles were the first on the Ethereum mainnet, dating as far back as May 2016. They are a completely open, public utility that anyone can access. This led to them being integrated in dozens of projects.\n\nIn particular, proliferation throughout the DeFi ecosystem and Ethereum initiatives such as ENS, made them a vital keystone. Unfortunately, due to the Oracle’s permissionless nature, it is unknown just how many projects have integrated the Oracles.\n\nOne of the reasons for integrating a whitelist into the Oracles in the first place is to get this transparent visibility of \"who is using the Oracles\" and \"how are they using them\". Considering this entangled ecosystem of users, it is imperative that Maker governors act as good-citizens and conduct the migration to Oracles V2 in a responsible and thoughtful manner. \"Pulling the rug out\" so to speak is not a viable option.\n\nBy overlapping Oracles V1 and Oracles V2, and waiving the Oracle Fee for one year, we give our users, and the ecosystem, time to plan their migration in a way that is convenient for them and their users. Take, for example, Gnosis who is using Oracles V1 in their DutchX Exchange. The DutchX smart contracts require a one month delay for swapping the Oracles. This is on top of the time it takes for Gnosis’ operations to evaluate, plan, and conduct the Oracle swap. By extending the service period of Oracles V1, and permitting free access to Oracles V2, we alleviate time pressures and facilitate the migration process.\n\n## Bootstrapping the Ecosystem\n\nNew projects are built on Ethereum everyday. Many of them require Oracles, but lack the resources to purchase them. If given the opportunity to succeed, many of these projects could become future customers.\n\nBy offering Oracles for free for one year, we may find an equilibrium point where MakerDAO can take a leadership position through supporting innovation and still benefit from a long-term relationship. After the one year trial, projects will have the option to continue the service by paying the Oracle Fee as set by MKR governors. At that point, these projects will have already built their product on top of the Oracles, have a good sense for how reliable and valuable the Oracle service is, and may view Maker on good-terms due to the one year of free service. That is an exceptional position to be in when convincing customers to purchase the Oracle service.\n\n## Free Trial Application Process\n\nTo apply for the one year free trial, prospective clients will need to submit a proposal to the [Oracles Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/oracles). This application must include several pertinent pieces of information for MKR governors to evaluate and verify.\n\n**Oracle Access Proposal Format:**\n\n1. Which Oracle(s) are desired (i.e., ETHUSD, ZRXUSD). Note this can include Oracles that don't exist yet and are not collateral types in the Maker Protocol.\n2. The contract address(es) that need to be whitelist.\n3. Confirmation that the smart contract(s) source code has been verified on etherscan.\n4. Confirmation that the applicant understands the Oracle prices must have a private scope within their system. In other words, there is no public facing variable that can be queried by any entity to circumvent the whitelist.\n5. A plain english description of how the Oracle data will be utilized.\n6. Keybase username for point of contact. This will be utilized to alert and discuss potential future updates, migration plans, and for emergency scenarios such as an Oracle attack.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Oracle Team(s) and MKR Governors to verify the information posted in applications. MKR Governors may modify the format of the Oracle Access Proposal and request additional information at any time. At the end of the evaluation cycle, all approved applications will be rolled up into a single executive proposal which will add them to the relevant Oracle whitelists.\n",

    "content": "# Poll: Ratify the Interim Oracle Team Mandate\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Maker Foundation is proposing a new role, the Oracle Team, which is responsible for the technical development and administration of the Oracles infrastructure. This role will follow the same 'interim' model shared by other foundation teams and is designed to, eventually, be entirely community-driven.\n\nAs this document represents a formalization of the role he already occupies on behalf of the community, the Foundation is proposing that Niklas Kunkel, Head of Backend Services, occupy the Oracle Team role in an interim capacity.\n\n**After a period of two weeks (set aside for debate and iteration on this framework) the community will have the opportunity to formally choose to accept or reject the proposal in a governance poll.**\n\n**Acceptance of the proposal will signal the ratification of the new role and the outlined responsibilities, as well as the person chosen to exercise its mandate.**\n\n## The Need for an Oracle Team\n\nOracles are a critical component of the Maker Protocol. They provide pricing data that determines the amount of Dai that can be drawn against a collateral asset, as well as when an outstanding position is in need of liquidation. Oracles are a live, dynamic infrastructure that presents a unique set of challenges. The Oracle infrastructure needs to be constantly maintained and updated to fix security vulnerabilities. Additional work needs to be done to optimize inefficiencies, support new asset types, support new price sources, incorporate emerging technologies, improve monitoring tools, increase decentralization, increase resilience, and decrease costs. Due to the broad scope of MKR governance’s other responsibilities and the constant attention required by Oracles, the MKR governance community needs a delegated party to handle these responsibilities on their behalf. A subject matter expert in a facilitator-like role is needed to aid the MKR governance community in their decision-making with respect to Oracles and to then implement those solutions.\n\n## Defining the Role & Responsibilities\n\nLike the other major governance-related roles, such as the Interim Risk Team and the Interim Governance Facilitator, the Oracle Team is empowered by the community to perform tasks on behalf of the community. However, the Oracle Team does not have the power to make unilateral decisions. Ultimately, major decisions are crafted into proposals requiring ratification by MKR Governance.\n\n### Oracle Liaison to MKR Governance\n\nThe Oracle Team serves as the intermediary between the MKR governance community and the Oracle ecosystem. The Oracle Team must attend the Governance calls and give regular updates with respect to Oracles as well as bring up relevant items for discussion to the community.\n\n### Oracle Liaison to Partners & Customers\n\nThe Oracle Team is authorized to act as a point of contact for partners and customers to coordinate initial discussions and programs. This allows the MKR governance community to leverage the networks and relationships of the Oracle Team. The Oracle Team must have the deep technical knowledge of the Oracle stack required to guide partners and customers through the services offered and assist with integration planning. The Oracle Team is permitted to discuss sensitive topics with partners that are not appropriate in the public domain such as when a partner requires an NDA or is pursuing a private pilot. An example of this is the Oracle Team approaching and creating a preliminary agreement with the first wave of DeFi Feed partners (Set, dYdX, Gnosis, and 0x), prior to the proposal being released to the community for endorsement. The intention here is not to sidestep MKR governance, but rather to have it act as a backstop through the proposal process. A good analogy of this is the United State where the executive branch has the ability to negotiate treaties, but they must be approved by the Senate. Ultimately, any substantive changes to the Oracle infrastructure or agreement to offer Oracle price services must be crafted into a proposal and presented to the MKR governance community for subsequent review and ratification.\n\n### Iterate and improve upon the Oracle Governance Framework\n\nThe Oracle Governance Framework (“OGF”) serves as the blueprint for the governance processes surrounding the administration of Oracles. As governance is still in its infancy, the OGF will be iterated and improved upon over time. Processes that are found to be lacking should be revamped. New processes to deal with unforeseen circumstances should be appended. All changes must be approved by the MKR governance community. It is the responsibility of the Oracle Team to work with the community to nurture this evolution.\n\n### Iterate and improve upon the Oracle Team Mandate\n\nMuch like the OGF, the Oracle Team Mandate (“OTM”) is a live document meant to be iterated on over time. New circumstances may arise that require the Oracle Team to take on new responsibilities not described in the OTM. Existing responsibilities may be removed or delegated to newly created roles. In such cases, changes to the OTM must be crafted into a proposal and ratified by the MKR governance community.\n\n### Research and Development\n\nThe Oracle infrastructure will need to be continuously updated and maintained to keep up with emerging technologies, security best-practices, new data types, new asset types, and general improvements to the protocol. It is the responsibility of the Oracle Team to conduct research, plan features, and implement deliverables.\n\n### Communicate and Schedule the Roadmap\n\nA roadmap detailing technical development and product development goals needs to be presented to the community by the Oracle Team and approved by MKR governance. Approval of the roadmap indirectly signals approval for all items contained within the roadmap. Progress of items on the roadmap will be presented by the Oracle Team on the governance calls.\n\n### Administrate Oracle Infrastructure\n\nOne of the major responsibilities of the Oracle Team is to manage the Oracle operations and infrastructure. These administrative duties include but are not limited to:\n\n- deploy Oracle smart contracts when upgrades are necessary\n- deploy Oracle smart contracts when new assets are added\n- assist Feeds to deploy their clients\n- assist Feeds to upgrade their clients\n- notify Feeds to upgrade their clients\n- notify Feeds when they go offline\n- notify Feeds if they appear to be compromised\n- distribute the Feed Stipend (temporary until governance takes over paying Feeds)\n- create best practices for security, fail-over mechanisms, monitoring.\n\n### Coordinate with other Ratified Teams\n\nThe Oracle Team will need to work closely with other ratified teams to coordinate cross-disciplinary collaboration. For example, the Oracle Team will have to work closely with Risk Teams for evaluating asset price sources, asset price models, and coming up with an appropriate oracle risk-compensation model.\n\n### Integrate New Asset Price Sources\n\nAs new prices sources emerge, they will need to be evaluated by the Risk Team(s) and integrated into the Oracle infrastructure. This could be from new exchanges entering the ecosystem, an asset getting listed on an exchange, or from new exotic asset classes having unique methods for polling their price. It is the responsibility of the Oracle Team to implement the solutions recommended by the Risk Team(s).\n\nThis could range from new exchanges entering the ecosystem, assets getting listed on new exchanges, to new asset classes having unique avenues for sourcing their prices.\n\n### Create Asset Price Model\n\nThe Oracle Team will work closely with the Risk Team(s) to research and develop models to consume sourced pricing data to calculate canonical asset prices. This might include filtering out outliers, weighting sources by volume, weighting Feeds by reputation, time-segmentation, and other methods not listed here. These models would need to be approved by MKR governance before being instantiated.\n\n## Create and Maintain a Sustainable Feed Incentives Model\n\nIt is imperative that the Oracles are fundamentally decentralized as they are a core module of the Maker Protocol. This ultimately means they are controlled through distributed governance and architected with a balanced incentive system to make them resilient and self-sustainable.\n\nCurrently, the set of incentives is skewed. Feeds are compensated for the valuable service they provide, to cover their infrastructure costs, and to discourage malicious behavior. As the Maker Protocol scales the incentives for bad behavior will continue to grow, and it will be necessary to increase compensation on a risk-adjusted basis. Technology improvements such as Feed staking, optimized price models, and the Oracle Security Module can help keep costs in check but are only one piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe second piece of the puzzle is to monetize the Oracle service by selling it to external customers through a whitelisting mechanism. In this manner, MKR governance can recoup Feed compensation costs or, at the very least, subsidize those costs. It is the responsibility of the Oracle Team to develop technology and monetization models which help reduce net expenditures for MKR token holders.\n\n### Create a Product Strategy\n\nWith Oracles becoming monetized, there needs to be a clear product strategy on how best to scale the system to reduce risk, reduce costs, and acquire customers.\n\n### Management of the Official Oracle Communications Channels\n\nThe Oracle Team is responsible for acting as the intermediary between the Feeds and governance. This includes the administration of a private pseudonymous chat containing only Feeds.\n\nCommunication on this chat by the Oracle Team is multi-faceted encompassing many of the responsibilities listed in the \"Administrate Oracle Infrastructure\" section including:\n\n- assist Feeds to deploy their clients\n- assist Feeds to upgrade their clients\n- notify Feeds to upgrade their clients\n- notify Feeds when they go offline\n- notify Feeds if they appear to be compromised\n- notify Feeds of an emergency situation\n- facilitate knowledge sharing of best-practices\n\n### Create Emergency Processes\n\nEstablish processes to follow during an emergency. Example of emergency processes include what to do during an Oracle attack. Another is the proper procedure to follow if a token forks or is upgraded. The Oracle Team is responsible for working closely with other MKR governance teams to come up with formal synergistic emergency plans, but their scope is limited to the Oracles themselves.\n\n## Onboarding/Offboarding Oracle Teams\n\nThis will be specified in the Oracle Governance Framework.\n\n## Compensation\n\nAs Niklas Kunkel is already being compensated by the Maker Foundation, there is currently no formal compensation tied to the Oracle Team role. In the future, governance may want to revise this mandate to append compensation in order to attract and incentivize external Oracle Teams.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf this mandate is accepted by the community, it will signal its support for the new Oracle Team Role and Niklas Kunkel as the first Oracle Team. This mandate should be considered a living document and will be updated based on community feedback.\n",

    "content": "# Poll: Migration Risk Construct Proposal\n\n## Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team\n\nPLEASE READ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS [HERE](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/risk/disclaimers%20to%20proposals%20and%20risk%20reports.md)\n\n## Introduction\n\nOn November 18th, 2019, the Maker Protocol is scheduled to upgrade to a new version called Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD). The current iteration, Single-Collateral Dai (SCD), will live in parallel for some indeterminate amount of time. During this overlap, the MKR community will be tasked with managing two Dai currencies, two stability fees, and, ultimately, two ecosystems. This presents a variety of risks to the Maker Protocol, and as a result, we, the Interim Risk Team at the Maker Foundation, are proposing a conservative migration strategy designed to mitigate overall risk.\n\n## Migration Overview\n\n**_Please note: the current SCD version of Dai will be called ‘Sai,’ and the new MCD version will be referred to as ‘Dai.’_**\n\n### MCD vs. SCD\n\nSCD has been in operation for almost two years now and has gained significant traction in the DeFi ecosystem. There are many benefits to the SCD protocol, such as battle-tested code and relative simplicity. However, we believe that that SCD users will eventually choose to migrate over to MCD for a variety of reasons:\n\n- Dai holders can take advantage of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR)\n- The DSR is a new governance tool for ensuring Dai stability\n- New security features such as the Governance Security Module, Oracle Security Module, and Emergency Shutdown Module\n- The introduction of additional supported collateral types\n- An improved liquidation process through the new MCD auction mechanism\n\nThese features should result in lower stability fees, improved liquidity, and future growth of the Maker Protocol.\n\n### Stakeholders\n\nThe current SCD protocol has four primary stakeholders: Sai holders, CDP owners, liquidity providers, and MKR token holders. The current Sai supply is roughly 90 million, which imposes the following responsibilities on these stakeholders:\n\n- **CDP owners** have collectively minted 90 million Sai from the Maker Protocol which must eventually be paid back to retrieve their collateral.\n- **Sai holders** are in possession of the 90 million outstanding Sai.\n- **Liquidity providers** participate in market making in order to keep Sai stable in the open markets.\n- **MKR token holders** are responsible for the ongoing governance of the protocol.\n\nThe goal of this Migration Risk Construct is to transport the above stakeholders from SCD to MCD in a safe and secure manner. This will be achieved by:\n\n- **CDP owners** redenominating their CDP Sai issuance into Dai\n- **Sai holders** exchanging their Sai for Dai.\n- **Liquidity providers** to start providing liquidity for Dai instead of Sai.\n- **MKR token holders** adapting to a new and improved form of governance.\n\nSai holders and CDP owners can migrate in a variety of ways. How they choose to do so entails different levels of risk and/or may impact the market negatively. A migration that occurs completely in the open market could represent an uncontrolled and potentially risky path for the ecosystem. For example, an undesirable path to migration is as follows:\n\n- Holders begin selling their Sai and buying Dai on the open market, incurring significant slippage. This results in downward pressure on Sai and upward pressure on Dai.\n- CDP owners purchase Sai on the open market (incurring slippage as well) in order to pay down their CDP. They then reestablish their position by minting and selling Dai in MCD, incurring slippage again.\n- Liquidity providers may not have sufficient balance sheet capacity to facilitate the amount of Sai and CDPs being migrated, resulting in peg instability.\n- MKR token holders would be required to actively micro-manage the monetary policy of both systems.\n\nThese scenarios are undesirable because:\n\n- they destabilize both the Sai price and the Dai price,\n- it could become more expensive for CDP owners to close their obligations, and\n- users incur slippage during some or all of the stages of the transition process.\n\n### Migration Contract\n\nDue to the potential for destabilization of both the Sai and Dai price, there will be a special migration contract included in the Maker Protocol. The functionality of the migration contract is contingent upon governance approving Sai as a collateral type in MCD.\n\nThe migration contract works as follows:\n\n- Sai holders can lock their Sai into the migration contract and generate Dai at a 0% stability fee and a 100% liquidation ratio. This is effectively a token swap from Sai to Dai.\n- The distinguishing feature of the migration contract is that it acts much like a shared CDP that anyone can access. Locked Sai can be made available to _other_ users (i.e., CDP owners in SCD needing to close their obligations).\n- CDP owners use this Sai liquidity to migrate their positions from SCD to MCD. This process reduces the Sai liquidity in the migration contract. Additionally, the used Sai is burned, leading to a reduction in the outstanding Sai supply.\n- As long as there is Sai liquidity in the migration contract, Dai holders may reverse their positions back into Sai.\n- Sai needs to exist in the migration contract in order for CDP owners to successfully upgrade. Otherwise, the contract will not be able to execute the migration.\n- CDP owners must repay their accrued stability fee in order to complete the migration. The migration app is designed to facilitate this process.\n\nBecause this process is fully contained in the migration contract, neither Sai holders nor CDP owners need to interact with public exchanges. This mitigates destabilization risks for both the Sai and Dai price. Further operational and technical details for this process can be found [here](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/mcd/upgrading-to-multi-collateral-dai/upgrading-to-multi-collateral-dai.md).\n\n### Emergency Shutdown\n\nWhen the community has determined that it is no longer possible to effectively manage the Sai ecosystem, or desirable to do so, an emergency shutdown will be triggered in SCD. An emergency shutdown is essentially an unwinding of the protocol, which allows Sai holders to redeem their tokens for \\$1 USD worth of ether (based on the oracle price at shutdown) and CDP owners to collect their collateral, minus the balance of their drawn Sai.\n\nOther emergency scenarios (some of which are described further below) may also necessitate an emergency shutdown to be triggered.\n\n## Governance Strategy\n\nThe launch of MCD represents a collection of significant improvements to the Maker Protocol. There are new governance levers (such as the DSR), a new liquidation process, and the inclusion of multiple collateral types. However, governance must manage numerous additional risk parameters, a significant increase from the current model of just two (stability fee and debt ceiling).\n\nAdditionally, the migration effectively represents a deleveraging of 90 million Sai and a potential re-leveraging of 90 million Dai. Two sudden supply shocks in a short period of time put a strain on market liquidity and threaten the stability of both Sai and Dai. Consequently, the risk team proposes what it believes is a conservative governance strategy, which is designed to mitigate potential risks during the migration process. Part of this strategy is the selection of the initial risk parameters, which the risk teams believes will help minimize any potential negative impact on the Sai and Dai price.\n\n### Stability Fee and DSR\n\nOne strategy for achieving a safe and orderly migration is to incentivize users to upgrade in a coordinated and predictable manner.\n\nA straightforward way to incentivize Sai holders to migrate is the introduction of the DSR, a tool that makes holding Dai more attractive compared to Sai. Given the absence of any empirical data, it is difficult to select a precise starting DSR value. However, a DSR of 2% is likely to be competitive with the broader DeFi ecosystem, which currently offers a ~6% (and dropping) savings rate on Sai. After adjusting for the added counterparty risk present in other platforms, a 2% DSR should incentivize a moderate amount of Sai holders to begin the migration. This parameter can be adjusted through governance as needed.\n\nFor CDP owners, a spread between the SCD and MCD stability fees should be sustained as well, ensuring it will be cheaper to mint Dai in MCD. The Eth stability fee spread could likely be 1-2% throughout the migration cycle. We propose a 1% stability fee spread to start. CDP users can often be insensitive to stability fee changes, so we do not expect an immediate and strong shift in CDP owner behavior. While a 1% spread may be too conservative, we recommend erring on the side of caution until more data becomes available.\n\nAnother incentive we would like to target is the sequence of migration for Sai holders and CDP owners. Given that CDP owners utilize Sai liquidity from the migration contract, it is important that enough Sai holders switch over to support the other migration participants. Otherwise, CDP owners will be forced to source Sai on the public markets, impacting prices.\n\nThere are multiple ways this sequencing can be achieved. First, from a practical standpoint, the Maker Foundation has been working with exchanges that hold large Sai balances to migrate as soon as possible on behalf of their users or to provide them with the tools to do so manually.\n\nBeyond the coordinated migration of our partners, however, governance can continue to use monetary policy if they so desire. An increase in the DSR or stability fee spread should impact stakeholders accordingly.\n\n### Debt Ceiling\n\nThere are several considerations to be made regarding the debt ceiling, which would be monitored and governed separately for SCD and MCD.\n\nDebt ceiling cap space is a critical tool for market makers to effectively carry out their role in helping keep Sai stable. Therefore, governance should ensure that there is always sufficient room in the debt ceiling so that market makers have sufficient access to Sai liquidity should they need it. We recommend a continuous 10-20 million Sai buffer.\n\nFor the MCD Eth debt ceiling, we propose 50 million, to be raised when needed. As the Sai supply migrates, the SCD outstanding supply is reduced. The debt ceiling should then be lowered to allow for simultaneous increases in the MCD debt ceiling. However, a minimum supply of Sai as a liquidity buffer for market makers should be kept intact, even as the maximum Sai debt ceiling goes down.\n\n### Monetary Policy Governance\n\nWhile our initial recommendation of risk parameters represents a logical starting point for the new protocol, standard operating procedure for governance still applies. Typical pressures such as changing demand for leverage, volatile ether prices, or sentiment shifts may still cause instability in the price of Sai or Dai. The governance community will continue to use the same general mechanisms to manage both the old and the new peg.\n\nBut, we also must now consider the possibility of additional migration-specific issues that could arise and require rapid adjustments to debt ceilings, stability fees, or the DSR. Governance must remain agile and vigilant with these monetary policy tools so that they can quickly respond to various market pressures.\n\nWhile we cannot predict the full gamut of possible situations, we highlight a few that might be relevant to the governance community in the coming weeks after launch.\n\n- The introduction of the DSR could mean that new capital flows into Sai, which would then be migrated into Dai and deposited into the DSR contract. The DSR might quickly buoy Sai and Dai prices above \\$1, necessitating immediate adjustments to monetary policy.\n- The Sai price is not expected to drop below \\$1, as the migration process would entail a steady stream of Sai demand.\n- There is a higher risk that the Sai price rises above \\$1. If this occurs, market makers need to be able to generate more Sai in order to keep the Sai price in line.\n- The Dai price may be strong or weak depending on the counteracting forces of DSR and new CDP generation (which puts downward pressure on Dai).\n- The Sai price is not expected to go below the Dai price because one can always swap Sai to Dai through the migration contract. The reverse depends on liquidity in the migration contract, however, and so the Dai price could dip below Sai.\n\nAs a general rule for policy tools, we suggest using the stability fee to target incentives instead of the DSR. Due to the relative immaturity of the DSR, it is likely to be ineffective (or unpredictable) as a monetary policy tool. Additionally, any stability fee changes should aim to keep the spread across SCD and MCD in line.\n\n### Emergency Shutdown\n\nCertain conditions may necessitate an early emergency shutdown. The most likely reason for this would be a shortage of Sai liquidity, leading to highly volatile prices and wide bid/ask spreads. Even with sufficient debt ceiling room, market makers may be unwilling to mint and sell Sai if there is an expectation that the price will continue to increase. For market makers to be willing to sell, they must be confident that emergency shutdown is a credible threat.\n\nBecause Sai would be redeemed at its target price of \\$1 USD in an emergency shutdown, perception would then help drive downward pressure on Sai towards the target price.\n\n### Governance Polls and Executive Votes\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of the migration, the community should be prepared to take unscheduled action with regard to monetary policy. In some cases, emergency action on short notice may be required. Consequently, the community should expect an increased number of governance calls, governance polls, and executive votes. Of note, the community should be on the lookout for emergency shutdown discussions and votes. The Maker Foundation will use all available communication platforms to notify the community when any such actions may be necessary.\n\n### Additional Collateral Types\n\nIn addition to ether (ETH), the risk team is proposing to launch with one additional collateral type, the Basic Attention Token (BAT), which scored the highest in the asset priority poll held in July. The primary reason for this addition at launch is so that engineers in the development community can fully test all of the features and functionality of the Maker Protocol. In the weeks following launch, a more formal analysis and risk evaluation of BAT will be released. For now, we propose a conservative debt ceiling of 3 million and, for simplicity’s sake, an identical stability fee to Eth.\n\n## Risk Analysis\n\nIn this section, we examine a cross section of migration risks along with potential mitigations. **This list is not exhaustive due to the unpredictable nature of the launch**. The following risks are listed in no particular order of likelihood or severity.\n\n### The pace of migration is too slow.\n\nA slow pace of migration could cause a number of undesirable side-effects relating to the stability of Sai or Dai. First, there will be a considerable increase in operational and social overhead required to manage two pegs and two sets of system parameters. These parallel ecosystems could also result in fractured liquidity, brand confusion, a lack of consumer confidence, and/or a disruption in business for our ecosystem partners.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nIt is difficult to quantify ‘too slow’ or pin down what the target timeline is for migration. However, the community should remain vigilant in the governance process in order to respond to market forces. For example, depending on the market’s reaction to the initial risk parameters, governance may choose to increase the DSR or stability fee spread if necessary.\n\n### The pace of migration is too quick.\n\nProtocol upgrades can often have unpredictable consequences, and a rapidly migrating user base could exacerbate any potential issues. Due to the length of time currently required to complete each governance cycle, the community may not be able to react to emerging threats to the system.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nSimilar to the above risk, governance must monitor the pace of migration and adjust risk parameters accordingly. Additional governance calls should also be held to speed up the governance process.\n\n### Borrowers on secondary lending platforms are unlikely to use the migration contract.\n\nSecondary lending platforms such as Compound and dYdX are some of the largest ecosystem users of the Maker Protocol. In total, roughly 50 million Sai has been deposited into these platforms. From that number, roughly 30 million Sai has been lent out to borrowers.\n\nThe borrowers on these secondary lending platforms resemble Maker CDP owners, in that they have Sai obligations against their collateral. However, Sai borrowers on secondary lending platforms may not have direct access to Sai liquidity from the migration contract to close their positions.\n\nThis has a few consequences:\n\n- Borrowers on lending platforms might vie for limited Sai liquidity on the open markets to repay their outstanding obligations. This could create upwards price pressure on Sai as 30 million or more Sai must be sourced.\n- Frictions involved in an open market migration may present too much overhead for borrowers. As a result borrowers may choose inaction, delaying the overall migration.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nThe standard response to an increase in Sai price is to decrease the stability fee such that market makers are incentivized to mint more Sai and push the price back downwards. This requires sufficient debt ceiling for market makers.\n\n### There is no Sai liquidity in the open marketplace or in the migration contract.\n\nThere is a risk that Sai liquidity will dry up, making it difficult for CDP owners and secondary Sai borrowers to migrate and potentially driving the Sai price upwards. This could happen for a variety of reasons:\n\n- An imbalance of incentives due to the MCD launch risk parameters causes CDP owners to migrate earlier or quicker than Sai holders.\n- Exchange liquidity has dried up due to exchanges migrating over to Dai.\n- Market makers cannot mint any more Sai due to the debt ceiling, or are unable due to capital constraints.\n- Market makers are unwilling to sell Sai because they do not feel confident that the price will return to \\$1, or they do not believe the likelihood of an emergency shutdown is credible.\n- Some portion of the Sai supply has been lost, making it mathematically impossible for all CDP owners to migrate.\n- Arbitrageurs mint Dai and drain Sai liquidity from the migration contract.\n- An attacker hoards a significant portion of the Sai supply to corner the market.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nIdeally, risk parameters are set in such a way that Sai holders are incentivized to migrate early, ensuring sufficient liquidity. However, if any of these scenarios occur, the Sai price may spike upwards. In some cases, market makers may not have the balance sheet capacity to temper the price. If this scenario persists, triggering emergency shutdown is the only available option. As a result, the community must be willing to undergo this emergency measure should the situation arise.\n\n### The MCD Eth debt ceiling increases exposure risk.\n\nTo facilitate CDP owners and secondary lending borrowers migrating over, an appropriate Dai debt ceiling must be set. However, the doubling of the global debt ceiling across SCD and MCD unintentionally increases exposure risk for the Maker Protocol. While this additional debt ceiling is intended specifically to facilitate CDP owners to migrate, there is nothing to stop new users (or an attacker) from utilizing this new debt ceiling space. This could trigger a supply shock and negatively impact Dai liquidity.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nIdeally, the MCD Eth debt ceiling should be low enough to protect against too much Dai being minted at once, but high enough to facilitate migration without exhausting the supply. While we don’t anticipate a sudden surge of new demand for Dai leverage, we believe the Maker Protocol should be able to handle an unexpected increase of 50 million in the Dai supply.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe bootstrapping of a second ecosystem within the Maker Protocol will involve managing a series of unknowns with our familiar governance tools, plus a few new ones. Due to the lack of empirical data available to us to accurately model a Multi-Collateral Dai which exists in concert with a Single-Collateral Sai, the Interim Risk Team recommends that the governance community approve this proposal to initialize the launch of MCD with a series of logical and conservative defaults. The Interim Risk Team believes the proposed parameters, as listed in the appendix below, will give the governance community a stable foundation with which it can begin to manage the new monetary policy requirements of a post-MCD world.\n\nIf this proposal is accepted by the community, it will signal its support for the following risk parameters to be initialized at the launch of MCD.\n\n## Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n### Collateral Type: Ether (ETH)\n\n| Parameter             | Value          |\n| --------------------- | -------------- |\n| Stability Fee         | Current SF -1% |\n| Debt Ceiling          | 50,000,000     |\n| Liquidation Ratio     | 150%           |\n| Auction lot size      | 50 ETH         |\n| Minimum bid increment | 3%             |\n| Bid duration          | 10 minutes     |\n| Max auction duration  | 3 days         |\n| Liquidation penalty   | 13%            |\n| Dust                  | 20 Dai         |\n\n### Collateral Type: Single-Collateral Dai (SAI)\n\n| Parameter             | Value       |\n| --------------------- | ----------- |\n| Stability Fee         | 0           |\n| Debt Ceiling          | 100,000,000 |\n| Liquidation Ratio     | N/A         |\n| Auction lot size      | N/A         |\n| Minimum bid increment | N/A         |\n| Bid duration          | N/A         |\n| Max auction duration  | N/A         |\n| Liquidation penalty   | N/A         |\n| Dust                  | N/A         |\n\n### Collateral Type: Basic Attention Token (BAT)\n\n| Parameter             | Value          |\n| --------------------- | -------------- |\n| Stability Fee         | Current SF -1% |\n| Debt Ceiling          | 3,000,000      |\n| Liquidation Ratio     | 150%           |\n| Auction lot size      | 50,000 BAT     |\n| Minimum bid increment | 3%             |\n| Bid duration          | 10 minutes     |\n| Max auction duration  | 3 days         |\n| Liquidation penalty   | 13%            |\n| Dust                  | 20 Dai         |\n\n### System Parameters\n\n| Parameter                              | Value       |\n| -------------------------------------- | ----------- |\n| Dai Savings Rate (DSR)                 | 2%          |\n| Global Stability Fee                   | 0%          |\n| Global Debt Ceiling                    | 153,000,000 |\n| Surplus Buffer                         | 500,000     |\n| Debt Auction Delay                     | 2 days      |\n| Governance Security Module Delay       | 0           |\n| Emergency Shutdown Module Delay        | 73 hours    |\n| Oracle Security Module Delay           | 1 hour      |\n| Oracle Feed Quorum                     | 13          |\n| Emergency Shutdown Threshold           | 50,000 MKR  |\n| Surplus Auction Lot Size               | 10,000 Dai  |\n| Surplus Auction Minimum Bid Increment  | 3%          |\n| Surplus Auction Bid Duration           | 30 minutes  |\n| Surplus Auction Max Duration           | 3 days      |\n| Debt Auction Lot Size                  | 50,000 Dai  |\n| Debt Auction Maximum Initial Bid       | 50 MKR      |\n| Debt Auction Minimum Bid Increment     | 3%          |\n| Debt Auction Max Auction Duration      | 3 days      |\n| Debt Auction Reinitialization Discount | 20%         |\n",

    "content": "# Vault Compensation Poll - April 06, 2020\n\nThe Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the community which the community can use to signal whether to move ahead with a plan to provide compensation to vault holders.\n\nThis Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for 7 days beginning on Monday, April 06 at 4 PM UTC.\n\n## Review\n\nFrom March 12-19, ETH (and BAT) suffered a quick drop. This created enormous network traffic. During some spans of time, the Maker price oracle failed to update due to unexpectedly high gas prices. Keepers bidding on auctions also had trouble with gas prices and with a lack of DAI liquidity. Many auctions settled with ETH valued at 0 DAI, or at far less than the market price.\n\nMost of these losses were absorbed by the Maker protocol and have been recapitalized via Flop auctions. However, vault owners also suffered some losses.\n\n**This was not unexpected.** Normal price fluctuations can easily wipe 100% of the collateral in vaults, even when auctions and oracles are operating optimally. [Additional details here.](https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/)\n\nHowever, the unusual circumstances left some vaults with less residual collateral then they might otherwise have had. Some vaults may legitimately expect to be left with a non-zero amount of ETH/BAT after a smoothly running auction had paid off their debt. The DAI value of vault holder losses (beyond what might be expected) had the protocol operated optimally has been roughly estimated to be less than 4 million.\n\n### Arguments for compensation\n\n* The protocol performed in a sub-optimal manner. Users (i.e. vault holders) were injured. It is in the interest of Maker holders to try to make their users happy. The purpose of the MKR token is to insure against precisely this kind of failure.\n* No compensation may represent a distortion of symmetry and reciprocity i.e. the impression that we’re marketing the product and receiving the reward for growth of the platform, but leaving ecosystem/development risk entirely to the user. This could negatively impact reputation and future mass adoption.\n* Avoid bad press and acrimonious gestures.\n\n\n### Arguments against compensation\n\n* Vault users are expected to understand the Ethereum ecosystem and accept the liabilities associated with using that system. All contract code is open sourced and available to be audited. As such, by using the protocol, it is understood that the users are adequately informed and accept the risk of their actions.\n* The keeper bot code is open-source. Users could have run a keeper to liquidate their own Vault at a favorable rate.\n* By compensating Vault users now, the community sets a precedent where it will compensate vault users in the future. This could undermine the game theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.\n\n### Even more background discussion\n\n* [Signal Thread: Do we compensate vault holders that were completely liquidated?](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/1713/43)\n* [Compensating vault holders that liquidated at 0 bid?!](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/1541)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**If this poll is decided as \"No\" then no further effort need be spent on a more exact estimate of vault holder losses.**\n\nIf this poll is decided as \"Yes\" then another on-chain poll will be held to decide whether the compensation (amount to be determined) will be denominated in Dai or the collateral asset that was liquidated.\n\n### Rough Outline of Next Next Steps\n\n**If this poll is decided as \"No\" then no further effort need be spent on mapping out the next next steps.** Therefore, the following is offered as a hand-wavy, possible process that will be refined due to the need for numerous stakeholders, both inside and outside the Foundation, to align. Despite the inherant uncertainty, a possible path toward compensating vault holders is important to start thinking about **now** before we commit to doing it.\n\n> An accurate estimate of the compensation amount for each affected vault shall be determined. To analyze the data, approx 2000 DAI (a week of analyst time) shall be requisioned. All vaults affected by suboptimal Maker/Ethereum performance are eligible for consideration, whether collateral was liquidated at zero or at some other level. Liquidated vaults that paid back debt or deposited additional collateral are also eligible. The estimate shall include sufficient documentation to facilitate replication.\n>\n> Once an accurate estimate of compensation has been determined, another poll will be needed to determine the X% haircut parameter.\n>\n> Vault holder compensation will be paid for with additional flop auctions. Once money is available, the assets will be put into a contract that vault holders can withdraw from. To withdraw, vault holders will need to browse to a web page where they agree to indemnify Maker and affiliates against any potential legal claims for their loss. The assets will be available for vault holders to claim for 30 days. After 30 days, the assets shall be converted back to DAI and deposited into the Maker system surplus account.\n\n---\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance Risk Framework: Governing MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework)\n\nDemos, help and instructional material for the Governance Dashboard can be found at [Awesome MakerDAO](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#voting).\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).\n",

The action of deactivating the Oracle will eliminate stability fees and incentivise users to migrate their CDPs during the grace period. This process helps the community of remaining CDP holders work together to drain the migration contract, and reduces the burden and exposure of liquidity providers needing to source large amounts of Sai for the migration contract in order to avoid unbacked debt in MCD.

    "content": "# Poll: Timing Poll to Proceed with the MIPs Ratification Vote - April 27, 2020\n\nToday, on April 27th, 2020, the Maker Community will vote to proceed with the ratification vote for the Initial 13 Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) and 2 Subproposals. The MIPs cover the Core Governance and Collateral Onboarding frameworks as well as two subproposals for onboarding an official MIP Editor and a Smart Contracts Domain team.\n\nIf passed, the Maker community will proceed with the Ratification Vote of the proposed MIPs and Subproposals on May 1-4.\n\n## Review: The 13 Initial MIPs and 2 Subproposals\n\n### The MIPs Framework\n\n**[MIP0 (The Maker Improvement Proposals Framework)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP0):** MIP0 defines and describes the MIPs Framework.\n\n- **[MIP0c12-SP1 (Subproposal for Core Personnel Onboarding)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP0/MIP0c12-Subproposals/MIP0c12-SP1.md):** MIP0c12-SP1 is for adding the first MIP Editor. \n\n### Core Foundational MIPs Set\n\n**[MIP1 (Maker Governance Paradigms)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP1):** MIP1 defines and describes Governance Paradigms and problem spaces.\n\n**[MIP2 (Governance Launch Period)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP2):** MIP2 details two interim phases during which logic defined in MIP0 is overridden.\n\n**[MIP3 (Governance Cycle)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP3):** MIP3 defines a monthly Governance Cycle with the aim of providing a predictable framework for Maker governance decisions.\n\n**[MIP4 (MIP Amendment and Removal Process)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP4):** MIP4 defines processes for the amendment and removal of accepted MIPs.\n\n**[MIP5 (Emergency Voting System)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP5):** MIP5 defines emergency changes to the protocol and Governance Facilitator role and how they should be handled in practice.\n\n### Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set\n\n**[MIP6 (Collateral Onboarding Form/Forum Template)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP6):** MIP6 defines a standardized application form used to kick off the process of onboarding a new collateral asset to the Maker Protocol.\n\n**[MIP7 (Domain Teams for Collateral Onboarding)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP7):** MIP7 defines processes for onboarding and offboarding domain teams.\n\n- **[MIP7c3-SP1 (Domain Team Onboarding)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP7/MIP7c3-Subproposals/MIP7c3-SP1.md):** MIP7c3-SP1 is for adding the first Smart Contracts Domain Team. \n\n**[MIP8 (Domain Greenlight)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP8):** MIP8 defines the process by which domain teams signal that a potential collateral type is worth the time spent investigating its inclusion in the Maker Protocol.\n\n**[MIP9 (Community Greenlight)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP9):** MIP9 defines the process by which MKR Token Holders can signal their judgment on the value of a potential collateral type before domain teams spend time thoroughly investigating its inclusion into the Maker Protocol.\n\n**[MIP10 (Oracle Requirements for Collateral Onboarding)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP10):** MIP10 defines how oracles are onboarded, offboarded, and managed in order to support the collateral onboarding process.\n\n**[MIP11 (Collateral Onboarding Risk Models)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP11):** MIP11 defines the requirements of general risk models and how they are onboarded and offboarded from the Maker Protocol.\n\n**[MIP12 (Collateral Onboarding and Risk Parameter Adjustment Process Documentation Requirements)](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/tree/master/MIP12):** MIP12 defines the domain team and documentation requirements for adding or changing collateral packages in the Maker Protocol.\n\n## Next Steps: Timing Poll Outcomes\n\n1. **Approval to proceed with the MIPs Ratification Vote**\nIf the Timing Poll resolves to proceed with the Ratification Vote of the proposed MIPs, the vote will occur over four days, May 1-4. If that vote resolves to \"Yes,\" the MIPs will be officially ratified and marked as “Accepted,” and the first Governance Cycle will begin on May 4. Once the Governance Cycle has begun, the formal submission of MIPs and Subproposals will occur between May 4 and May 6.\n\n2. **Delay the MIPs Ratification Vote for one month**\nIf the Timing Poll resolves to \"no\", the Ratification Vote is effectively delayed for one month, where a competition process would begin immediately. The competition process is a MIPs proposal process, where multiple versions of MIPs can be proposed as alternative choices to the intially proposed MIPs. For example, several versions of MIP3, which describe the Governance Cycle, might be presented.\n\n   The deadline for submitting competing proposals would be May 20. The community would then proceed to vote for the proposal version they want to be included in the final MIP Set and put up for the ratification vote. Voting would occur May 23-26.\n\n   Lastly, the final Ratification Vote would begin on May 27 and end on May 30. If the vote resolves to \"Yes,\" the MIPs will be officially ratified and marked as \"Accepted,\" and the first Governance Cycle would begin on June 1. Once the Governance Cycle has begun, the formal submission of MIPs and Subproposals will occur between June 1 and June 3.\n\n## Resources\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance Risk Framework: Governing MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework)\n\nDemos, help and instructional material for the Governance Dashboard can be found at [Awesome MakerDAO](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#voting).\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).\n",

Please review to inform your position before voting.\n\nA summary of the proposed changes:\n\n1. Replace all weekly Stability Fee votes with a single, global `Base Rate` vote.\n2. The individual `Stability Fee` parameters will be calculated by the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`.\n3. The `Base Rate` will be initialized to 0%. The `Risk Premium` of each collateral will be initialized to its `Stability Fee`.\n4. The `Risk Premium` of any collateral type can be adjusted by initiating a governance poll.\n5. The lowest value of `Base Rate` will either be 0% or no lower bound depending on the result of this poll. The implications of this are discussed in the thread.\n6. The `Dai Savings Rate Spread` calculation will use the `Base Rate` to determine the Dai Savings Rate value in the same way it is currently offset from the `Dai Stability Fee`.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* If this proposal passes, the changes listed in Review will be made starting the week of May 25th, 2020.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance Risk Framework: Governing MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework)\n\nDemos, help and instructional material for the Governance Dashboard can be found at [Awesome MakerDAO](https://awesome.makerdao.com/#voting).\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).\n",

Please review the [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to see if there has been any discussion on the vote this week to inform your position before voting.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf the winning result of this poll differs from the current **Base Rate** parameter value in the Maker Protocol then this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. \n\nIf the Friday executive passes, then this rate change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voter onboarding guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/onboarding/voter-onboarding) to learn how to use this dashboard and set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance Risk Framework: Governing MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework)\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).\n\n",

This poll will run for two weeks, from Monday, September 7 at 16:00 UTC to Monday, September 21 at 16:00 UTC.\n\nNote: This poll started slightly later than described above due to the need to redeploy it to fix the [incorrect vote type](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/error-in-vault-compensation-poll/4024) in the initial version.\n\n## Review\n\nThe Vault Compensation Plan was discussed in the [Forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/vault-compensation-plan-v2/3584/97) and presented on the [August 13 Maker Governance and Risk Call](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-105-thursday-august-13-4-00-pm-utc/3570). Voters are encouraged to review the plan document and discussion to inform their position before voting.\n\nThis poll uses ranked choice voting. Details about ranked choice voting can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-add-ranked-choice-voting-as-an-option-for-governance-polls/1274). The community is encouraged to select multiple options in their order of preference, while withholding their vote for any options they consider unacceptable. \n\nClaim amounts will be calculated based upon the compensation percentage decided in this poll, using the “tab change in relation to collateral change” calculation method described in the plan document, paid out in MKR tokens at a rate of 1 MKR per 250 DAI. Individual vault compensation will be determined by the formulae below:\n\n`MKR compensation amount = (collateral deficit percent * collateral value in DAI) / 250`\n`collateral deficit percent = compensation percentage (determined by this poll) - percent of vault collateral already received from liquidation`\n`collateral value in DAI = debt tab at time of liquidation * liquidation ratio`\n\nThe MKR amounts shown for each percentage represent the sum of calculated compensation for ETH vaults, multiplied by 1.5. The additional 50% buffer is intended to cover claims from BAT vaults as well as from vaults that self-liquidated their position. It is considered highly unlikely that 100% of eligible vaults will claim compensation, so any residual unclaimed MKR can be retrieved and disposed of by MKR governance once the compensation process has been completed. \n\nIn addition to the MKR required for paying compensation claims, each poll option except for “0% (oppose vault compensation)” or “Oppose current compensation plan (support vault compensation)” also authorize 50,000 DAI to be released to the compensation working group to cover operating expenses such as working group labor and smart contract development. Any unused DAI funds will be returned to the Maker surplus account upon project completion. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this poll resolves with a majority of votes in favor of 3% through 24.67% compensation, the compensation working group will proceed with development and voting steps outlined in phase 2 of the vault compensation plan.\n\nIf this poll resolves with a majority of votes in favor of “0% (oppose vault compensation)”, this matter will be considered closed by governance and no further action will be taken regarding vault compensation.\n\nIf this poll resolves with a majority of votes in favor of “Oppose current compensation plan (support vault compensation)”, or if this poll resolves with no option receiving at least 50% support, this will be considered a vote of no confidence in the current vault compensation working group.

This value will depend on the outcome of the executive vote taking place on Friday, September 25, 2020.\n\nThis Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, September 28 at 16:00 UTC, the results of which may inform an Executive Vote which will go live on Friday, October 2, at 16:00 UTC.\n\n## Review\n\nThe **PAXUSD-A Debt Ceiling** was voted on in a forum signal request. Please review the [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-increase-paxusd-a-debt-ceiling/4263) to inform your position before voting.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll. \n\nIf the Friday executive passes, then this debt ceiling change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [Governance Security Module](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/govsec-module) delay has expired.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voter onboarding guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/onboarding/voter-onboarding) to learn how to use this dashboard and set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance Risk Framework: Governing MakerDAO](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-risk-framework)\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).\n",

The Base Rate will no longer be voted on after this proposal passes, and a MIP18 vote will be added to deprecate it formally.\n* Formation of the Rates Working Group. A somewhat loosely defined group consisting of Domain Team Facilitators and community members. Initial members being @hexonaut, @Primoz, @LongForWisdom, @monet-supply, @SebVentures and @Akiva.\n* Introduction of the Competitive Rate: A rate which is based on the competitive landscape. For example if our competition is offering borrowing at 5% for a particular asset, we may decide to offer that same asset for 4%.\n* The Rates Working Group will keep track of governance directives, risk premiums and competitive rates to produce a set of stability fees for each vault type. Mostly this will involve setting the rates by competitive analysis coming from risk.\n* The Risk Team will start producing Risk Premium / Competitive Rates on a monthly basis which get handed off to the Rates Working Group who will propose the Stability Fee rate changes.\n* Dai Savings Rate will remain at 0% until governance signals otherwise.\n* Development of a more formal MIP as this process is smoothed out.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal passes then:\n\n* The plan described above will be implemented.\n* There will be no base rate votes starting the week of October 19th.\n* The Risk team will produce numbers starting week of October 19th.\n* The Rates group will make their first proposal in the forums starting the week of October 19th.\n* The Rates group will create a governance poll for October 26th which, pending success, will go into the Friday executive.\n\nIf this proposal fails to pass then:\n\n* The status quo will remain.\n* The Rates group will work to produce an alternative proposal based on feedback.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).\n\n",

    "content": "# Poll: Stablecoin Action Plan - November 2, 2020\n\nThe MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition for the implementation of the Stablecoin Action Plan.\n\nThis Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 2 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n## Review\n\nPlease refer to the Stablecoin Action Plan [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-stablecoin-action-plan/4808) for an overview of the proposed plan. **Option 3 - Migrate Users to a new Vault Type** had the highest level of support in the signal request. A brief summary of this option is provided below.\n\nThe tentitive plan is that the Rates Working Group will work with the Smart Contracts Team to add an executive spell which will set both the Stability Fee and Debt Ceilings to 0 on the following vault types:\n\n * USDC-A\n * TUSD-A\n * PAXUSD-A\n\n This executive will then add the following vault types with the same settings, original Stability Fees and appropriate Debt Ceilings:\n\n * USDC-C\n * TUSD-B\n * PAXUSD-B\n\nThe target for this executive spell is Friday, December 11 - the approximate date at which the leading edge of vaults will reach 100% Collateralization Ratio without putting the action too close to the holiday break. \n\nThe Rates Working Group will sumbit a governance poll on Monday, December 7, 2020 to confirm the executive is still desired at that time. This plan may also be cancelled or amended at any point between now and December 7, 2020 via a Signal Request and Governance Poll.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this poll ends with a 'Yes' majority, then an additional governance poll will run on the week beginning Monday, December 7, 2020 to reconfirm this action closer to the target implementation date.\n\nIf this poll ends with a 'No' majority, then further options to deal with stablecoin vaults will be discussed on the forum.\n\n---\n\n# Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n\n",

    "content": "# Poll: Accelerate the Peg Stability Module Launch - November 23, 2020\n\nThe MakerDAO Governance Facilitator has placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the Maker Governance community which gives Maker Governance the chance to signal their support or opposition to accelerating the PSM launch.\n\nThis Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, November 23 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n## Review\n\nThe Peg Stability Module (PSM) can be used to replace the 101% collateralization ratio stablecoin vaults which will reach 100% collateralization by approximately December 18th. Currently, the plan is to replace these stablecoin vaults with duplicates as per the [Stablecoin Action Plan](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmY1vJPs?network=mainnet#vote-breakdown) vote from 2 weeks ago. Partway through the vote, a new option became available - the PSM, so we are running this vote to determine if MKR holders prefer the PSM instead.\n\nThe PSM provides many benefits over the status quo:\n\n * Restore the peg. We can move the price into a tighter spread because we no longer need to worry about liquidations.\n * Fee collection is upfront and exact instead of having to time rollovers at 100% CR.\n * No longer have to worry about liquidations as the PSM will self-unwind when Dai drops below $0.999.\n * Additional profit on the unwinding stage which would previously have gone to vault holders.\n * We enable very large traders to go between Dai and Stablecoins without slippage.\n\nThe proposed initial parameters for the PSM are `tin` of 0.1% and a `tout` of 0.1%. To maximize fee collection the `tin` parameter will be initialized at 1% and lowered continuously to 0.1% over a week. The PSM will be initially rolled out for at least USDC and (time permitting) to the other stablecoins as well. Debt ceilings will be made high enough to allow as much supply as needed to return the peg to 1.001 USDC.\n\nPlease review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-accelerate-the-psm-launch/5094) to further inform your position on this issue before voting.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* The Domain Teams will prioritize the PSM and aim for a tentative launch date of Friday, December 18th, 2020. \n* A forum post will be made to track the status of technical audits and risk assessment of the PSM. \n* The 'Stablecoin Action Plan - Option 3' will no longer be pursued.\n\n**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* We will proceed with the 'Stablecoin Action Plan - Option 3' as previously voted.\n* An additional poll will be run to determine the date on which we switch to new stablecoin vaults as detailed in the 'Stablecoin Action Plan - Option 3'\n* The PSM may or may not be added later via the regular monthly MIPs cycle.\n\n---\n\n# Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 16:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n\n",

For explanations of the three collateralization ratio parameters, please check the risk assessment linked below.\n\nPlease review the following forum threads containing information about NS-DROP (New Silver DROP) to inform your position before voting.\n* [Initial Collateral Application](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-mip6-application-new-silver-drop-real-estate-backed-loans/3477)\n* [Risk Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/5418/1)\n* [Smart Contracts Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns2drp-ns-drop-mip22-token-smart-contract-domain-team-assessment/5517)\n* [Oracles Evaluation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/ns-drop-collateral-onboarding-oracle-assessment-mip10c3-sp21/6178)\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* NS-DROP (New Silver DROP) will be onboarded in a future executive vote as the Smart Contracts domain team's schedule allows. \n* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 60 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.\n* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.\n\n**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

    "content": "# Interim DAO Budget - February 8, 2021\n\nThe Governance Facilitator(s) have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the DAO Autonomous Group. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, February 8 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n**This is a binary vote. In a binary vote, you may vote for a single option. You should vote for the option which you prefer. Alternatively, if you would accept either of the two options and have no preference between them, you should vote 'Abstain'.**\n\n## Review\n\nThe DAO Autonomous Group has been growing since its inception. We now have 10+ members actively working to move towards the decentralized future of Maker. As our responsibilities have been scaling up, so have our bills. So far, we have been able to cover all significant expenses thanks to the Foundation grants program. However, with the introduction of the community-led PSM this is no longer the case. We believe it is time to take the next step towards the decentralized funding of operations within MakerDAO.\n\nThe DAO Autonomous Group has set up a 4-of-5 Gnosis multi-sig wallet which will be administered by the following mandated domain facilitators:\n\n * **@LongForWisdom** - 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69\n * **@Primoz** - 0x5d67d5B1fC7EF4bfF31967bE2D2d7b9323c1521c\n * **@SebVentures** - 0x0D61C8b6CA9669A36F351De3AE335e9689dd9C5b\n * **@juanjuan** - 0xFCa6e196c2ad557E64D9397e283C2AFe57344b75\n * **@hexonaut** - 0x18CaE82909C31b60Fe0A9656D76406345C9cb9FB\n\nThe multi-sig wallet can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73f09254a81e1F835Ee442d1b3262c1f1d7A13ff#code). This multi-sig wallet and the funds contained within are owned by Maker Governance but administered by the keyholders listed above. Governance has the power to withdraw all funds back to the Governance-controlled PauseProxy contract at any time. This provides a safety mechanism for lost keys and a way for governance to revoke access to funds in the future.\n\nAs of this poll, 52,627.15 DAI will be used to cover previous expenses:\n\n* **Quantstamp Audit** -  40,000.00 DAI  \n* **PSM / DssGovRewards Development Time** - 11,435.70 DAI  \n* **Deployment Gas Expenses** - 1,191.45 DAI  \n\nThe remaining balance will be used to cover ongoing community development costs that the Foundation grants program cannot cover. All payouts from this multi-sig will be cataloged in a publically accessible document. \n\nPlease review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-interim-dao-operating-budget/5924) to help inform your position before voting. \n\n## Outcomes\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* A one-time transfer of 100,000 DAI from the Maker Protocol to the aforementioned multi-sig wallet will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.\n* If the Friday executive passes, then this transfer of funds will take place after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.\n\n**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

This will be achieved by increasing the System Surplus Buffer over time using a linear interpolation smart contract, instead of directly setting it to the target value of 60 million DAI. \n\nBecause the option for 25% burn requires predicting the increase of fees over the next few months, the 25% goal is a target rather than a guarantee. \n\nPlease review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-adjust-the-surplus-buffer-march-april-2021/6979) to inform your position on this issue before voting.\n\n# Outcomes\n\n**If a non-'Abstain' option receives more votes than each other option (excluding 'Abstain') and the support for that option exceeds 50% of the total votes cast (excluding 'Abstain' votes), then the following actions will be taken:**\n* If the result requires a change to the current setting, the change will be included in a weekly Executive Vote on a Friday within the next 30 days.\n* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.\n\n**Otherwise, no further actions will be taken at this time.**\n\n# Resources\n\nUnsure about the System Surplus Buffer parameter and what you should take into account when voting?

The canonical version of this letter is on IPFS [here](https://ipfsgate.com/ipfs/QmYDpsrhpnBNp4N8ASGCprw8iVEN8tLMGxzkzDNkgaNNWH). The contents have been pasted below for convenience.\n\n---\n**Petition Letter**\n\nto the attention of the Andreessen Horowitz [A16z Crypto team](https://a16z.com/crypto/#vertical-landing-staff).\n\nFollowing its [investment thesis](https://a16z.com/crypto/#vertical-landing-investment-thesis) and its long term vision on DeFi, A16z crypto [has invested in MakerDAO in September 2018](https://blog.makerdao.com/part-2-a-primer-on-dai/). The involvement of A16z crypto brought a new level of excitement and credence to the MakerDAO community and [has helped its development](https://a16z.com/2019/11/17/maker-governance-multi-collateral-dai/) over the course of the last few years. Currently A16z owns [the wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x05e793ce0c6027323ac150f6d45c2344d28b6019) with the third largest amount of MKR tokens and therefore owns more than 6% of the voting power in the MakerDAO governance system.\n\nSince September 2018 MakerDAO has managed to achieve outstanding technical results, including the [successful launch of multi-collateral DAI in 2019](https://a16z.com/2019/11/17/maker-governance-multi-collateral-dai/), and today is undoubtably one of the [leading protocols](https://defipulse.com/) in the DeFi space. This amazing growth has been enabled by an engaged decentralised community coordinated and supported by the [Maker Foundation](https://makerdao.com/en/about), a private organisation lead by Rune Christensen, one of the founders of MakerDAO.\n\nAs planned from the very beginning, however, the Maker Foundation is going to be dissolved soon. This event corresponds to a critical, historical and exciting moment for MakerDAO: the decentralised community will have to manage itself and its DeFi protocol successfully without relying on a single centralised organisation.\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, the MakerDAO decentralised community has made significant steps towards decentralisation. Several *Core Units*, independent and focused groups of contributors paid by MakerDAO with the profits of the protocol, are being proposed, discussed and approved via the Governance process. But the path towards full decentralisation is hard, full of intricacies and is resource consuming. The help of all members of our decentralised community is now more needed than ever.\n\nOne of the [key objectives of A16z crypto](https://a16z.com/2021/02/05/on-crypto-governance/) is:\n\n> **``Put simply, our primary objective in governance is to create the conditions necessary for protocols to achieve long-term adoption and self-sustainability.''**\n\nFor the above reasons, the MakerDAO decentralised community wishes to ask the full participation and support of A16z in this important moment. We'd be thrilled to be able to interact in a fully transparent way (forums, chats, onchain governance, etc), in the true spirit of DeFi, with the incredibly talented [A16z Crypto team](https://a16z.com/crypto/#vertical-landing-staff).\n\nSpecifically, we encourage A16z to:\n\n1. Participate in onchain governance and voting, using the 60k MKR tokens in [their wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x05e793ce0c6027323ac150f6d45c2344d28b6019).\n2. Through some chosen representative, participate actively in [chat](https://chat.makerdao.com/) and [forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/) discussions.\n3. Bring ideas and expertise to the community: legal, recruiting processes, marketing, communication, business opportunities, etc.\n4. Interact and challenge the existing and forthcoming Core Units to make sure they meet the highest standards of quality.\n\nWe, the MakerDAO decentralised community, are proud to have you onboard and can't wait to interact with you to keep developing our protocol and innovating in the DeFi space.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nMakerDAO community\n\n---\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**Regardless of the outcome of this poll, no actions will be taken at this time.**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

Oracles are a critical component of securing the Maker Protocol to ensure positions are sufficiently collateralized. The OCU is essential to ensure the Oracles can adapt rapidly to scale the Maker Protocol in a responsible manner. A key focus of the OCU is to monetize the Oracle Protocol and build out a business around it. This enables the DAO to subsidize its own Oracle expenditures, and ultimately turn Oracles from a cost-center into a profit-generating arm of MakerDAO.

These parameters may be freely changed in the future by MakerDAO.\n\t* Origination Fee: 1%\n\t* [DC-IAM](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) gap: 50m\n\t* [DC-IAM](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) ttl: 8h\n\t* [DC-IAM](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-dciam) line: Equal to initial [Debt Ceiling](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-debt-ceiling)\n\n#### First Six Months\n* Every additional 100m DAI minted in each vault will reduce the [Stability Fee](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) by 10 basis points for that vault down to a minimum of 0.5%. The starting point for this calculation is the amount of DAI initially migrated by MakerDAO on behalf of Nexo.\n* Failure to maintain 200% CR over the majority of any 7 day period will result in increasing the SF to 5% and increasing the LR to 150%. The 7 day period would be calculated by ensuring that 95% of the OSM updates show that the CR is equal to or greater than 200%.\n* The [Stability Fee](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) will not change in the initial six months with the exception of changes under the previous two points.\n* Reductions in [Stability Fee](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) are not automatic, and must be voted through by Maker Governance. The Growth Core Unit is responsible for initiating reduction proposals on behalf of Nexo.\n\n#### Subsequent Six Months\n* The Growth Core Unit will facilitate discussions to determine parameters and terms for the subsequent six months prior to the end of the first six months.\n* If the first six month ends without a decision, the previous risk parameters and operating conditions will persist until a decision is made.\n* The [Stability Fee](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-stability-fee) will only increase by a maximum of 1% over each six months period so long as **none** of the 'Exceptional Conditions' listed below are met.\n\n#### Exceptional Conditions\n* The total amount of fixed rate debt is more than 50% of MakerDAO's debt backed by stablecoin collateral (including stablecoin LP positions.)\n\n### Links and Comments\n* This poll text has been reviewed and agreed on by the GovAlpha Core Unit, the Growth Core Unit, the Risk Core Unit, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit, and [Nexo](https://nexo.io/).\n* This agreement represents our best attempt at setting mutually agreeable conditions for both parties. However, changes may be proposed if both Nexo and the involved Core Units agree that these conditions are in some way unsuitable.\n* Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-nexo-institutional-vault/10046) to help inform your position before voting. \n* For further details on the contract mechanisms used to implement this vault type, check [MIP59](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP59).\n* A Risk evaluation is available [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/nexo-institutional-vault-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/10524).\n* A revenue impact assessment is available [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/institutional-vaults-economics-terms/9989).\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* These vaults will be onboarded and migration of Nexo's positions will take place in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. \n* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.\n* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.\n\n**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

I had a pleasure to work with many of you, providing information and insights, answering questions and building data related products. With the help and inspiration of many people I created the EthTx.info transaction decoder as well as the MCDState, MCDGov and Liq2.0 datasets.\n Currently, after leaving the Foundation I’m involved in building Token Flow, a venture dedicated to monetizing blockchain data inside and outside the DeFi ecosystem. I believe I’m well suited to become a part-time Facilitator of the Data Insights CU and serve MakerDAO with my experience with data and the Protocol.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Cannonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/3fbfda3cf6326fd0f77cf670f7c0b0cd2dc522b2/MIP41/MIP41c4-Subproposals/MIP41c4-SP23.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41c4SP23)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c4-sp23-facilitator-onboarding-for-data-insights-cu-din-001/10211)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value.

In the world of traditional software engineering, building a Minimum Viable Product either validates or invalidates your product idea. However, real validation is gained from the market when the MVP is released to the public. Real validation is not the promise to use the product but only the product usage itself.\n While the current setup of the Maker DAO allows for incremental and low-risk improvement of the existing product, the current framework is not set up for pursuing revolutionary product ideas.\n Therefore we propose a new MakerLabs Core Unit that implements new product ideas spanning across the full stack of decentralized technologies. \n Having full technological responsibility inside a single Core Unit would give MakerLabs the autonomy to move fast and ultimately test and validate new ideas early.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Cannonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/3fbfda3cf6326fd0f77cf670f7c0b0cd2dc522b2/MIP39/MIP39c2-Subproposals/MIP39c2-SP21.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP21)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp21-adding-makerlabs-core-unit/9425)\n\n### MIP40c3-SP32\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*We estimate this budget for the MakerLabs Core Unit to successfully implement and validate MVPs for the Maker ecosystem. More details about the scope and content of the Core Unit can be found here.\n We’re proposing the following budget to deliver on our mandate. This includes, but is not limited to: Implement, Deploy, and Validate MVPs in the Maker ecosystem.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Cannonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/5334d4cc29cf9f0dfd1e8bbf326668696e709420/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP32.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP32)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp32-adding-makerlabs-core-unit-budget/10108)\n\n### MIP41c4-SP22\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*I joined the crypto ecosystem pretty late (winter 2017) but learned about Maker quite early as there were very few projects around. The idea of taking a loan on a collateral in a permissionless way, without a man in the middle and by that providing a pegged asset into the volatile crypto market was very appealing to me so I started following and using the product. I believe we did a great job so far on focusing on the core without getting distracted too much. However, I think we should start running more experiments - something MakerLabs can support.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Cannonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/2cf92ba215147968223ab2c729ee00da3e712dbc/MIP41/MIP41c4-Subproposals/MIP41c4-SP22.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41c4SP22)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c4-sp22-facilitator-onboarding-makerlabs/10109)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value.

This involves dedicated services to the Maker ecosystem, effectively establishing a security partnership with the DAO.

Recognised Delegates are currently compensated only if both their voting and communication metrics are 90% or higher. The compensation method for this trial can be found in [MIP61](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip61-delegate-compensation/10640). If successful, this proposal will make the following changes for the duration of the trial, or until voted otherwise.\n- Delegate compensation will continue to be calculated per the formula detailed in MIP61, with a Performance Modifier applied to the eligible amount, based on the Recognised Delegate's lowest scoring metric.\n- Recognised Delegates with both metrics at or above 75% will become eligible for compensation. If either metric is below 75%, the Recognised Delegate will receive no compensation.\n- There will be a linearly scaled Performance Modifier applied to the eligible amount when the lowest scoring metric is between 75% and 90%. When the lowest scoring metric is 75%, compensation will be modified to 40% of the eligible amount and when the lowest scoring metric is 90% or greater, compensation will be 100% of the eligible amount.\n\nPlease review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-introduce-a-performance-modifier-to-the-delegate-compensation-trial/11850) to help inform your position before voting.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* Payments to qualifying delegates will be modified starting in December, distributed via executive vote at the end of each month.\n\n**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

The reward was specified at 100,000 DAI “if the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote.” This part is clear. “All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than USD 50,000.” The words no more than suggest that an inequality is intended.

Currently, no funds are available in the multi-sig, but it can still claim ~3.8k DAI from their canceled budget stream.*\n\n*Seeing as the Content Production Core Unit is no longer an active Core Unit for the DAO, there is only downside to leaving their multi-sig Governance recognized. Given the small amount of funds that can still be claimed, there is little danger to publicly announce our intentions to close the loop with the DssVest stream. However, this process is clearly vulnerable to front running until the procedure for reclaiming funds and permissions is improved.*\n\n*If this subproposal is accepted, there will be the technical work of claiming the budget funds and returning them to the surplus buffer, to be completed in a future executive proposal.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/5c9f74ab48176eaadcc68363e2b2108d78127a76/MIP47/MIP47c3-Subproposals/MIP47c3-SP1.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP47c3SP1)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip47c3-sp1-dissolution-of-content-production-mkt-001-multi-sig-request/13991)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value.

    "content": "# Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022\n\nThe Governance Facilitators have placed a budget ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, June 13 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n**This is an instant-runoff vote.** \n- **You may rank any number of options that you would support in an executive vote.** \n- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**\n- **If you have no preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**\n\n## Review\n\nThe community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP70 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol by ranking their support of the following options:\n* **Option 0:** Abstain.\n* **Option 1:** Approve increased budget (BaseGrowth): 5,085,157.11 DAI.\n* **Option 2:** Approve increased budget (BearMarket): 4,210,261.40 DAI.\n* **Option 3:** Approve existing budget only (BrandlessGrowth): 3,272,550.00 DAI\n* **Option 4:** Reject budget.\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*MIP40c3-SP70 requests a 12-month budget of 5,085,157.11 DAI for the Growth Core Unit starting from July 2022 (Option BaseGrowth).*\n\n*Due to the current market situation, we decided to propose a second option (option BearMarket) with a reduction in the objective FTEs, which will slow down our roadmap for H2-22 to H1-23. Option BearMarket requests a 12-month budget of 4,210,261.40 DAI for the Growth Core Unit starting from July 2022.*\n\n*Personnel reduction from the original plan, although feasible, will have an impact on the roadmap execution of both teams (Growth and Brand) and the number of strategic initiatives we can run with our partners. In case option BearMarket is elected, we will:*\n\n* *Reduce the number of new business opportunities or associations that require a high intensity of work (usually high impact partnerships).*\n* *Instead of having a specialization approach (per region and vertical), we will continue with a generalist approach.*\n* *Merge the communications and content team.*\n* *Instead of having a separate team working on the brand, BDs will continue developing the Maker brand with our partners, with the PR agencies' support.*\n\n*Although this is a more conservative approach and gives us time as a DAO to define the next steps towards MetaDAOs or any other path MKR holders decide, it's essential to understand that this will slow down Growth's CU roadmap (BDs+Brand).*\n\n**Option BaseGrowth** *(5,085,157.11 DAI) represents a 55% increase compared to last year's approved budget. This increase in budget will support our growth in FTE, allowing us to expand our presence in other regions and have all people needed to run the Brand team.*\n**Option BearMarket** *(4,210,261.40 DAI) represents a 28% increase compared to last year's approved budget. We won't be growing the team as planned but will be able to execute our plan with some constraints.*\n**Option BrandlessGrowth** *(3,272,550.00 DAI) represents a 0% increase compared to last year's approved budget. If MKR holders select his option, we won't be able to continue with the Brand team plan.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/34cce188049e6d6d1adcfcaf0c4fde1c6e4f7085/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP70.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP70)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp70-modify-growth-core-unit-budget-gro-001/15102)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value.

This would allow the task force access to the expedited governance process described in [MIP75](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP75).\n* Reject Task Force - ranking this option supports the rejection of the Growth Task Force, granting no special privileges or funding. \n\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*It is our view that we are in a nascent stage of crypto, and controlling as much future market share as possible is critical for the survival of this project.

Example: Aave D3M.\n- Real-World Assets Vaults - Vaults lending against Real-World Assets (as opposed to crypto assets). Example: New Silver.\n- Real-World Asset Arrangers - Lending through arrangers that set up their own real-world loans based on criteria approved by Maker Governance. Example: 6s.\n- Core Crypto Collateral - ETH and BTC implementations (including their derivatives). Example: Wrapped Staked ETH.\n- Alternative Ethereum-based Crypto Collateral - Other ERC-20 crypto asset tokens. Example: LINK.\n- Crypto Collateral from Other Chains - Lending against crypto assets on other chains/L2s. Example: OP (Optimism, not currently supported).\n- Traditional Financial Instruments - Using Real-World Financial Instruments for backing DAI. Example: US Treasuries (Government debt, not currently supported).\n- Peg Stability Solutions - Solutions designed to strengthen the DAI peg to the US Dollar. Example: USDC PSM.\n\nPlease review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/prioritization-framework-sentiment-polling/15554) to help inform your position before voting.\n\n**Note: The voting portal will display the \"leader\" of the Ranked Choice Vote as the poll continues, and the \"winning option\" upon completion.

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 4 weeks beginning on Monday, June 6 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n\n**This is an instant-runoff vote.** \n- **You may rank any number of options that you would support for priority consideration.** \n- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) for priority consideration.**\n- **If you have no priority preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**\n\n## Review\n\nThe community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:\n- [Flapper Distributor](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/flapperdistributor-a-way-to-distribute-system-surplus-while-minimizing-governance/4591) - A way to split revenue and direct it toward different causes, like buyback/burn and filling the surplus buffer simultaneously. This item has not been formally voted on or developed, meaning that a proposal would likely need to be submitted for technical work to take place beyond initial scoping.\n- [Sagittarius Engine](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sagittarius-engine/10852) - Tokenomics design from Rune, including staking MKR and the ability for those with MKR staked to borrow against it. This item has not been formally voted on or developed, meaning that a proposal would likely need to be submitted for technical work to take place beyond initial scoping.\n- Collateral Onboarding - Focusing on technical work for onboarding more collateral types into the protocol.\n- [Compound D3M](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-maker-prioritize-onboarding-a-compound-d3m/11997) - D3M implementation similar to the Aave D3M that would target a DAI borrowing rate at Compound. \n- [MIP43: Term Lending Module (TLM)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip43-term-lending-module-tlm/6153) - Fixed-rate solution for Maker vaults, requiring code review and implementation of a previously passed technical MIP.\n- [Maker Teleport](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-wormhole-new-name-maker-teleport/15115) - Enabling \"Fast Withdrawals\" between L2s and L1, and eventually between L2s. This is a prerequisite for Multi-collateral DAI deployment on L2s. Read the original scoping [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introducing-maker-wormhole/11550).\n- [DssKiln](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/dsskiln-a-permissionless-token-purchasing-tool/14943) - Tool for permissionless token purchasing over time. Could be used for targeted MKR buybacks or acquiring treasury assets. \n- [DssSnog](https://github.com/brianmcmichael/dss-snog/blob/master/src/DssSnog.sol) - Authorizes the Oracle Core Unit to give readers access to oracle prices without having to give authorization via a governance executive, mentioned [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/pecu-month-in-review-april-2022/14942#prototyping-5).\n- [DssGate](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-and-risk-173-thursday-january-06-17-00-utc/12480/2#updates-dssgate-and-future-parameter-management-9) - \"Sandbox\" tool that allows for a limited amount of DAI to be at risk when implementing new technical solutions. The current use-case is for Deco Core Unit to develop fixed-rate lending vaults without changing the core smart contracts of the protocol.\n- [MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module (`Vox`)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip20-target-price-adjustment-module-vox/3196) - Module that would enable negative DAI rates, requiring code review and implementation of a previously passed technical MIP.\n- [ESM Simulations](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/agenda-discussion-scientific-governance-and-risk-163-thursday-october-14-17-00-utc/10972/2#governance-security-and-flexibility-esm-delay-parameters-9) - Devoting technical resources to simulating the Emergency Shutdown Module, where DAI would be redeemable for the collateral backing it.\n- [Returning \"Lost\" DAI](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/minting-new-dai-to-offset-lost-dai/6396) - Technical solution to returning/reissuing DAI verifiably lost, like in cases of transfer to the DAI contract address.\n\nPlease review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/prioritization-framework-sentiment-polling/15554) to help inform your position before voting.\n\n**Note: The voting portal will display the \"leader\" of the Ranked Choice Vote as the poll continues, and the \"winning option\" upon completion. These assertations should be ignored. For updates on the state of the vote, check below this text for the weekly updates from GovAlpha and live explorer from Data Insights.**\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**Weekly updates will be shared with the Maker Community to detail the feedback from Priority Sentiment Polls. No Governance action will be mandated upon their conclusion. GovAlpha hopes that these polls will:**\n- Encourage more dialogue between MKR holders and Core Units about prioritization.\n- Convey valuable MKR sentiment to those contributing to the DAO.\n\nSuggestions for items to be included on future Priority Sentiment Polls may be submitted [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGMqLqzV-ySAiU_AhqeVuwGwgYFGpTYpEDvdNSzXo9Wi4U-w/viewform?usp=sf_link) along with additional feedback for the process as a whole.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

Events are a 'nice to have' and not required for this bear market, particularly considering how Daivinity was executed. Mkr token holders’ money was spent on unknown attendees and no business deals or new hires have been credited to that event. Given current budget constraints, the protocol simply does not accrue value from a core unit whose mission statement is: 'To provide the best MakerDAO branded event experience to the crypto & Maker community including industry professionals, influencers, and enthusiasts'. And so this core unit should be granted severance and offboarded.\"*\n\nThe proposal author has proposed a one-off payment to the Core Unit of 103,336 DAI as a golden parachute in the event that the off-boarding is approved by MKR holders.\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/e07030723333c8ce6259dfac63f0a47988cf17fb/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP73.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP73)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp73-modify-core-unit-budget-events-001/15991)\n\n### MIP41c5-SP8\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the Author and is shown below:\n\n*See the [sister sub proposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp73-modify-core-unit-budget-events-001/15991) to remove the budget from this core unit.

CRVV1ETHSTETH-A\n* LINK-A\n* MANA-A\n* MATIC-A\n* RENBTC-A\n\n**Note:** The Risk Core Unit summarizes these changes as follows:\n\n*The effect of these changes is a shorter average settlement duration:*\n\n* *From about 28 minutes to 15 minutes for (st)ETH and WBTC high-to-mid liquidation ratio vault types*.\n* *From about 19 minutes to 10 minutes for ETH and WBTC low liquidation ratio vault types*.\n* *From about 40 minutes to 27 minutes for \"tier two\" vaults (higher volatility and lower liquidity collateral)*.\n\n### [Max Auction Drawdown (`cusp`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/collateral-auction/param-max-auction-drawdown) Changes\n\nThe following collateral types will have their `cusp` increased by 0.05, from 0.4 to

Core Unit summarizes these changes as follows:\n\n*The intention of these changes is to satisfy the condition of keeping maximum duration until the auction price reaches about 50% of OSM.*\n\n### [Local Liquidation Limit (`ilk.hole`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/collateral-auction/param-local-liquidation-limit) Changes\n\nThe following `ilk.hole` changes will be made:\n\n* Decrease the ETH-A `ilk.hole` from 65,000,000 DAI to **40,000,000 DAI**.\n* Decrease the ETH-B `ilk.hole` from 30,000,000 DAI to **15,000,000 DAI**.\n* Decrease the WBTC-A `ilk.hole` from 40,000,000

**2,000,000 DAI**.\n\n**Note:** The Risk Core Unit summarizes these changes as follows:\n\n*Because faster auction cycles are being proposed, about 50% more collateral should get settled per unit of time.*\n\n### [Global Liquidation Limit (`Hole`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-global-liquidation-limit) Change\n\nThe `Hole` will be reduced by 30,000,000 DAI from

    "content": "# Ratification Poll for Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication (MIP55c3-SP11) - December 12, 2022\n\nThe Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, December 12 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n**This is a binary vote.**\n- **You may vote for a single option.**\n- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**\n- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**\n\n## Review\n\nThe community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to [MIP55c3-SP11](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP55c3SP11) being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*Build the industry’s first DeFi-focused dataset. The data will be used to tune a Large Language Model (BLOOM). A fine-tuned model integrated into Maker’s pipelines will help gradually relax current Risk CU modeling assumptions, thereby delivering millions of dollars of missed value for the DAO & Maker users. A fine-tuned model may also provide opportunities to expand and improve on governance communications. Furthermore, a DeFi-focused dataset offers extensibility across other DAOs.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/36e8b451d6a47000ea6284a9a2b43b6c81deeb96/MIP55/MIP55c3-Subproposals/MIP55c3-SP11.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP55c3SP11)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip55c3-sp11-pioneer-defi-focused-language-dataset-for-the-benefit-of-risk-modelling-governance-communication/18802)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**\n* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, December 15.\n* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).\n\n**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n[MIP51: Monthly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51) describes this type of poll and its position and significance within the rest of the governance cycle.\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n\n",

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, January 9 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n**This is a binary vote.**\n- **You may vote for a single option.**\n- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**\n- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**\n\n## Review\n\nMKR Voters may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following parameter changes:\n\n### Stability Fee Increase\n\n* Increase the WSTETH-B [Stability Fee](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee) by 0.25% from 0% to **0.25%**.\n\n### DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Changes\n\n#### Compound v2 D3M Changes\n\n* Increase the [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) by 15 million DAI from 5 million DAI to **20 million DAI**.\n* Set [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) to **5 million DAI**.\n\n#### Aave v2 D3M Changes\n\n* Reactivate the Aave v2 D3M.\n* Set [Target Borrow Rate (`bar`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit#target-borrow-rate-bar) to **2%**.\n* Set [Maximum Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#maximum-debt-ceiling-line) to **20 million DAI**.\n* Set [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) to **5 million DAI**.\n\n**Governance Facilitator's Note:** It is likely that Protocol Engineering will move to upgrade the Aave v2 D3M to the more recent implementation used for the Compound v2 D3M. If this is done, since it is a new implementation, a more cautious Debt Ceiling may be used initially. Final confirmation will be provided by PE and GovAlpha prior to any relevant Executive Vote.\n\n### PSM Changes\n\n* Increase the PSM-USDP-A [Fee In (`tin`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-psm#fee-in-tin) by 0.1% from 0.1% to **0.2%**.\n\nPlease review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/parameter-changes-proposal-ppg-omc-001-5-january-2023/19327) to help inform your position before voting.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**\n* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.\n* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.\n* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.\n\n**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n",

This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, January 9 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n**This is a binary vote.**\n- **You may vote for a single option.**\n- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**\n- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**\n\n## Review\n\nThe community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c4-SP2 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*In an effort to simplify the growing body of DAO governance processes and policies, this subproposal repeals [MIP14](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP14) in its entirety due to obsolescence.*\n\n*Originally passed in October of 2020, MIP14 outlines a generic procedure for DAI to be sent from the protocol to an Ethereum address. It does not appear to have ever been utilized, and the transfer of DAI for a number of purposes has typically been authorized through whatever governance action authorizes the activity financed by that transfer.*\n\n*Additionally, any subproposal under MIP14 would require a 4-week feedback period for sums between 10,000 and 100,000 DAI, and a 12-week feedback period for sums above 100,000 DAI. These thresholds make MIP14 impractical to use, but with no clear need for this MIP, repeal is favored over amendment.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/f58a8ac17a9d639cbc9c53e74ab04c6a27064f28/MIP4/MIP4c4-Subproposals/MIP4c4-SP2.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c4SP2)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip4c4-sp2-mip14-repeal/18533)\n* [Removal Pull Request](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/pull/734)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**\n* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, January 26.\n* The above-referenced pull request will be merged into the MIPs repository.\n* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).\n\n**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n[MIP51: Monthly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51) describes this type of poll and its position and significance within the rest of the governance cycle.\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works/) to learn how voting works, and this [wallet setup guide](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/voting-setup/) to set up your wallet to vote.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Governance](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance) section of the MakerDAO community portal.\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Public Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=makerdao.com_3efhm2ghipksegl009ktniomdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC&mode=week&showCalendars=0&showPrint=0).\n\n",

[MIP14c4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP14#MIP14c4) places a cap on the total amount of DAI that can be distributed through MIP14. The number chosen, 250,000 DAI, is arbitrary and amendment requires a full Monthly Governance Cycle.*\n\n*Consequently, a failure state exists where the sum of all fund requests in a Governance Cycle through MIP14 will exceed the ceiling and/or it will not be possible to raise with sufficient lead-time to distribute Maker Governance approved funds in a timely manner. Rather than dealing with sequential subproposals to raise the Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling, or setting it to an arbitrarily high number that renders it useless, it makes more sense to simply remove this restriction.*\n\n*The remaining content of MIP14 remains appropriate, in my opinion.

Afterward, SAS was allowed to operate on leftover funds to bridge the funding gap. This proposal creates a new budget stream for the Core Unit to continue operations from 2023-04-01 onwards.*\n\n*The structure of the budget maximizes accountability in light of the current uncertainty on precise Endgame requirements. As SAS transitions towards becoming a Full-Stack Development Ecosystem Actor for the Endgame, this budget will cover:*\n\n- *Pre-Project Endgame Work (current examples include: Contributing to Governance Security -Scope creation, Evaluation of a NoCode Tool for Spell creation, various contributions to increase developer accessibility)*\n- *Maintenance of Existing Software (Auctions UI and APIs, …)*\n\n*As we want to operate as transparently as possible, every time SAS finds an opportunity with a clearly defined project with a fixed budget, we’ll use the project budget instead of the CU budget.*\n\n*A current example: For at least the next two months, we’ll be working on the Ecosystem API (Switchboard) Project. The respective monthly project budget will cover 60-80 % of the monthly CU budget. This means that 60-80 % of the SAS CU budget during these months will be refunded to the DAO. Overtime, as more Endgame projects become clearer, there will be various project budgets available. Therefore, the CU budget will be used less.*\n\n*This subproposal creates a new budget stream for the Core Unit to continue operations from 2023-04-01 to 2024-03-31.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/0966a7d3d69d42701051fe3013ec55750d1672ea/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP95.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40c3SP95)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp95-modifying-sidestream-auction-services-core-unit-budget-sas-001/19737)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value.

This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/monthly-governance-cycle#week-2) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, March 13 at 16:00 UTC.\n\n**This is a binary vote.**\n- **You may vote for a single option.**\n- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**\n- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**\n\n## Review\n\nThe community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP4c2-SP34 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.\n\nA brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:\n\n*MIP41 defines Facilitators as “accountable individuals”. The term individual is defined as “a single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution” (Merriam Webster Dictionary). This potentially limits participants from engaging as facilitators should they want to apply specifically as a liability protected entity. By expanding the definition to “authorized accounts,” entities will be able to apply as facilitator while specifying accounts that can engage in Maker Governance with the full power of the facilitator, while still retaining the consent of MKR holders.*\n\nPlease review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.\n* [Canonical Proposal Version](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/1157c2bb06523c65ee23c68d11fb8e14ad5ad36c/MIP4/MIP4c2-Subproposals/MIP4c2-SP34.md)\n* [Latest Proposal Version](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c2SP34)\n* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip4c2-sp34-expand-facilitator-definition-to-allow-entities/19736)\n* [Amendment Pull Request](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/pull/846)\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThis poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.\n\n**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**\n* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, March 30.\n* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).\n\n**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n[MIP51: Monthly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51) describes this type of poll and its position and significance within the rest of the governance cycle.\n\nIf you are new to voting in the Maker Protocol, please see the [voting guide](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/voting-in-makerdao/on-chain-governance) to learn how voting works.\n\nAdditional information about the Governance process can be found in the [Maker Operational Manual](https://manual.makerdao.com).\n\nTo participate in future Governance calls, please [join us](https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/pubcall-:-governance-and-risk) every Thursday at 17:00 UTC.\n\nTo add current and upcoming votes to your calendar, please see the [MakerDAO Governance Calendar](https://manual.makerdao.com/makerdao/calendars/governance-calendar).\n",
